(This package is planned to eventually move to\n`@webcomponents/ssr-dom-shim` to better reflect this use case). There are two\nmain patterns for providing access to these shims to users:\n\n1. Assigning shims to `globalThis`, ensuring that assignment occurs before\n   user-code runs.\n\n2. Importing shims directly from the module that provides your base class, using\n   the `node` [export\n   condition](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports) to\n   ensure this only happens when running in Node, and not in the browser.\n\nLit takes approach #2 for all of the shims except for `customElements`, `Event`\nand `CustomEvent`, so that users who have imported `lit` are able to call\n`customElements.define` or `new Event(...)`/`new CustomEvent(...)` in their\ncomponents from Node.\n\n### Exports\n\nThe main module exports the following values. Note that no globals are set by\nthis module.\n\n- [`EventTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget)\n  - [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)\n  - [`dispatchEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent)\n  - [`removeEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener)\n- [`Element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element)\n  - (Inherits from EventTarget)\n  - [`attachShadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow)\n  - [`shadowRoot`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/shadowRoot)\n  - [`attributes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attributes)\n  - [`hasAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/hasAttribute)\n  - [`getAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getAttribute)\n  - [`setAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute)\n  - [`removeAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/removeAttribute)\n- [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)\n  - (Inherits from Element)\n- [`CustomElementRegistry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry)\n- [`customElements`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/customElements)\n- [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)\n- [`CustomEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md)."

While every custom element build from `SpectrumMixin` could have its `dir` attribute applied to manage this, doing so is not only a pain for apply, it's a pain to maintain over time. To support the flexibility to deliver content in both of these directions, elements built from `SpectrumMixin` will observe the `dir` attribute of either the `document` or a containing `sp-theme`. This will allow your sites and applications to manage content direction in a single place while also opening the possibility of having multiple content directions on the same page by scoping those content sections with `sp-theme` elements.\n\nPlacing a `dir` attribute on an element built from `SpectrumMixin` before attaching it to the DOM will prevent it from resolving the text direction value to a parent `sp-theme` or `document` element. Elements applied to the page in this way will also NOT participate in observing any such elements, so their `dir` values will remain as initialized regardless of changes in other parts of your documents. If you choose to leverage this, be aware that any child (in both light DOM and shadow DOM) of this element will need to have a `dir` attribute applied as well if you do not want it resolving to a parent `sp-theme` or `document` element itself. In this way, it is likely that you would benefit from leveraging an `sp-theme` element to create scope in your document for managing this custom content direction section of your page.\n\n#### `isLTR`\n\nWhile CSS offers many powerful solutions for styling content in various directions, sometimes JS functionality depends on the specific of that direction. Elements built from `SpectrumMixin` have the `this.isLTR` getter that will resolve to `true` when `dir === 'ltr'`.\n\n#### public shadowRoot!: ShadowRoot;\n\nElements built from `SpectrumMixin` assume that you will be using shadow DOM in the resulting custom element. To simplify TypeScript usage the presence of `this.shadowRoot` is asserted as non-null so that you have direct access to it without extended type checking."

All `<sp-button>` variants support these states.\n\n#### Disabled\n\nWhile disabled, `<sp-button>` elements will not respond to click events and will appear faded.\n\n```html\n<sp-button-group>\n    <sp-button variant=\"primary\">Normal</sp-button>\n    <sp-button variant=\"primary\" disabled>Disabled</sp-button>\n</sp-button-group>\n```\n\n#### Pending\n\nWhile in pending state, `<sp-button>` elements will not respond to click events and will appear faded with an indeterminate `<sp-progress-circle>`.\nThe `<sp-button>` element's label and icon will be hidden while in pending state.\n\nNote: The pending state of the `<sp-button>` element is applied after a 1s delay to avoid flashing the pending state for quick actions. You can override the delay by adding custom css var `--pending-delay` to your css.\n\n```html\n<sp-button-group>\n    <sp-button variant=\"primary\">Normal</sp-button>\n    <sp-button variant=\"primary\" pending>Pending</sp-button>\n</sp-button-group>\n```\n\n### Behaviors\n\n#### Handling events\n\nEvents handlers for clicks and other user actions can be registered on a\n`<sp-button>` as one would on a standard HTML `<button>` element.\n\n```html\n<sp-button onclick=\"spAlert(this, '<sp-button> clicked!')\">Click me</sp-button>\n```\n\nIn addition to handling events like a native `<button>` HTML element, one can also use a `<sp-button>` in place of the `<a>` HTML element by using the `href` and optional `target` attribute.\n\n```html demo\n<sp-button\n    href=\"https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n>\n    Click me\n</sp-button>\n```\n\n#### Autofocus\n\nThe `autofocus` attribute sets focus on the `<sp-button>` when the component\nmounts. This is useful for setting focus to a specific sp-button when a\npopover or dialog opens.\n\n```html\n<sp-button id=\"trigger\">Open</sp-button>\n<sp-overlay trigger=\"trigger@click\" placement=\"bottom\">\n    <sp-popover>\n        <!-- Button will autofocus when open -->\n        <sp-button autofocus>Confirm</sp-button>\n    </sp-popover>\n</sp-overlay>\n```\n\n### Accessibility\n\n#### Include a label\n\nA button is required to have either a visible text label or a `label` attribute on either the `<sp-button>` itself\nor on an `<sp-icon*>` element child.\n\n#### Don't override color\n\nDo not use custom colors for buttons. The colors of different button variations have been designed to be consistent and accessible.\n\n#### Don't mix href and non-href buttons in a set of buttons\n\nA screen reader user will not encounter href buttons when navigating by buttons or form controls. While they can both be used in the same page problems could occur if mixing the types in close proximity to each other.\n\n#### Use static black or static white to contrast with backgrounds and images\n\nTo ensure maximum contrast with the background, use static black for light backgrounds and images, and static white for dark backgrounds and images. Avoid placing static components on top of busy images with a lot of variance in contrast.\n\n<sp-tabs selected=\"black\" auto label=\"Static variants for contrast\">\n<sp-tab value=\"black\">Static black on light background</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"black\">\n\n```html demo\n<div\n    style=\"background-color: var(--spectrum-docs-static-black-background-color); padding: 20px\"\n>\n    <sp-button static-color=\"black\">Click me</sp-button>\n    <sp-button static-color=\"black\" treatment=\"outline\">Click me</sp-button>\n</div>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"white\">Static white on dark background</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"white\">\n\n```html demo\n<div\n    style=\"background-color: var(--spectrum-docs-static-white-background-color); padding: 20px\"\n>\n    <sp-button static-color=\"white\">Click me</sp-button>\n    <sp-button static-color=\"white\" treatment=\"outline\">Click me</sp-button>\n</div>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n</sp-tabs>\n\n#### Clearly state the action\n\nMake sure that a button’s label clearly states the outcome of the action. Use the same word or phrase as found elsewhere in the experience."

The blue color\nprovides a visual prominence that is optimal for forms, settings, lists or grids\nof assets, etc. where the checkboxes need to be noticed.\n\n```html\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: space-between;\">\n    <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column;\">\n        <h4 class=\"spectrum-Heading--subtitle1\">Default</h4>\n        <sp-checkbox emphasized>Web component</sp-checkbox>\n        <sp-checkbox emphasized checked>Web component</sp-checkbox>\n        <sp-checkbox emphasized indeterminate>Web component</sp-checkbox>\n    </div>\n\n    <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column;\">\n        <h4 class=\"spectrum-Heading--subtitle1\">Invalid</h4>\n        <sp-checkbox emphasized invalid>Web component</sp-checkbox>\n        <sp-checkbox emphasized checked invalid>Web component</sp-checkbox>\n        <sp-checkbox emphasized indeterminate invalid>\n            Web component\n        </sp-checkbox>\n    </div>\n\n    <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column;\">\n        <h4 class=\"spectrum-Heading--subtitle1\">Disabled</h4>\n        <sp-checkbox emphasized disabled>Web component</sp-checkbox>\n        <sp-checkbox emphasized checked disabled>Web component</sp-checkbox>\n        <sp-checkbox emphasized indeterminate disabled>\n            Web component\n        </sp-checkbox>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n</sp-tabs>\n\n### States\n\n#### Invalid\n\nThe `invalid` attribute indicates that the checkbox's value is invalid. When set, appropriate ARIA attributes will be automatically applied.\n\n```html\n<sp-checkbox invalid>Invalid</sp-checkbox>\n```\n\n#### Disabled\n\nThe `disabled` attribute prevents the checkbox from receiving focus or events. The checkbox will appear faded.\n\n```html\n<sp-checkbox disabled>Disabled</sp-checkbox>\n```\n\n#### Indeterminate\n\nThe `indeterminate` attribute sets the checkbox to an indeterminate state, visually distinct from both checked and unchecked states.\n\n```html\n<sp-checkbox indeterminate>Indeterminate</sp-checkbox>\n```\n\n#### Read-only\n\nCheckboxes have a `readonly` attribute for when they’re in the disabled state but still need their labels to be shown. This allows for content to be copied, but not interacted with or changed.\n\n```html\n<sp-checkbox readonly>Read-only</sp-checkbox>\n```\n\n### Behaviors\n\n#### Handling events\n\nEvent handlers for clicks and other user actions can be registered on an `<sp-checkbox>` as they would a standard `<input type=\"checkbox\">` element.\n\n```html\n<sp-checkbox\n    id=\"checkbox-example\"\n    onclick=\"spAlert(this, '<sp-checkbox> clicked!')\"\n>\n    Check this box to see an onclick alert.\n</sp-checkbox>\n```\n\n### Accessibility\n\nCheckboxes are accessible by default, rendered in HTML using the `<input type=\"checkbox\">` element. When the checkbox is set as `indeterminate` or\n`invalid`, the appropriate ARIA state attribute will automatically be applied.\n\n#### Include a label\n\nEvery checkbox must have a label that clearly describes its purpose. The label can be provided as content within the `<sp-checkbox>` element.\n\n```html\n<sp-checkbox>Send me text messages.</sp-checkbox>\n```\n\n#### Label groups of related checkboxes\n\nSets of checkboxes should always have a clear label that describes what the list of options represents and guides users what to do. This is important for accessibility, since a screen reader will read the label before each option. (See [field group's label documentation](/field-group/#label) for more information.)\n\n```html\n<sp-field-group label=\"Select your toppings\">\n    <sp-checkbox>Ketchup</sp-checkbox>\n    <sp-checkbox>Mustard</sp-checkbox>\n    <sp-checkbox>Pickles</sp-checkbox>\n</sp-field-group>\n```\n\n#### Keyboard Navigation\n\nCheckboxes can be toggled using the <kbd>Space</kbd> key when focused. They follow the standard tab order of the page.\n\n#### Screen readers\n\nScreen readers interpret checkboxes by announcing their role, label, current state, and role to the user. This allows users relying on assistive technology to understand and interact with the checkbox effectively.\n\nWhen focused, a screen reader will announce:\n\n- The label (text provided inside the or associated with it)\n- The state: \"checked\", \"not checked\", or \"partially checked\" (when indeterminate is set)\n- The role: \"checkbox\"\n- If the checkbox is marked as invalid, it may also announce \"invalid entry\" depending on the screen reader."

When using the `negative-help-text` slot, `<sp-field-group>` will self manage the presence of this content based on the value of the `invalid` property on your `<sp-field-group>` element. Content within the `help-text` slot will be show by default. When your `<sp-field-group>` should receive help text based on state outside of the complexity of `invalid` or not, manage the content addressed to the `help-text` from above to ensure that it displays the right messaging and possesses the right `variant`.\n\n<sp-tabs selected=\"self\" auto label=\"Help text usage in field groups\">\n<sp-tab value=\"self\">Self managed</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"self\">\n\n```html\n<sp-field-group horizontal id=\"self\" label=\"What are your favorite fruits?\">\n    <sp-checkbox value=\"apple\">Apple</sp-checkbox>\n    <sp-checkbox\n        value=\"not-a-fruit\"\n        onchange=\"javascript:this.parentElement.invalid = this.checked\"\n    >\n        Lettuce\n    </sp-checkbox>\n    <sp-checkbox value=\"strawberry\" checked>Strawberry</sp-checkbox>\n    <sp-help-text slot=\"help-text\">One of these is not a fruit.</sp-help-text>\n    <sp-help-text slot=\"negative-help-text\" icon>\n        Choose actual fruit(s).\n    </sp-help-text>\n</sp-field-group>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"above\">Managed from above</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"above\">\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"above\">What are your favorite fruits?</sp-field-label>\n<sp-field-group horizontal id=\"above\">\n    <sp-checkbox value=\"apple\">Apple</sp-checkbox>\n    <sp-checkbox\n        value=\"not-a-fruit\"\n        onchange=\"\n            const helpText = this.parentElement.querySelector(`[slot='help-text']`);\n            helpText.icon = this.checked;\n            helpText.textContent = this.checked ?

A field without a label is ambiguous and not accessible.\n\n#### Include help text\n\nThe description in the help text is flexible and encompasses a range of guidance. Sometimes this guidance is about what to input, and sometime it’s about how to input. This includes information such as:\n\n-   An overall description of the input field\n-   Hints for what kind of information needs to be input\n-   Specific formatting examples or requirements\n\nLearn more about [using help text](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/text-field/#Use-help-text-to-show-hints,-formatting,-and-requirements).\n\n#### Include negative help text\n\nWrite error messaging in a human-centered way by guiding a user and showing them a solution — don’t simply state what’s wrong and then leave them guessing as to how to resolve it. Ambiguous error messages can be frustrating and even shame-inducing for users. Also, keep in mind that something that a system may deem an error may not actually be perceived as an error to a user.\n\nLearn more about [writing error messages](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/text-field/#Write-error-text-that-shows-a-solution).\n\n#### Do not us a placeholder as a replacement for a label or help-text\n\nPutting instructions for how to complete an input, requirements, or any other essential information into placeholder text is not accessible. Once a value is entered, placeholder text is no longer viewable; if someone is using an automatic form filler, they will never get the information in the placeholder text.\n\nInstead, use the help text description to convey requirements or to show any formatting examples that would help user comprehension. If there's placeholder text and help text at the same time, it becomes redundant and distracting, especially if they're communicating the same thing."

An input without a label is ambiguous and not accessible. In rare cases where context is sufficient and an accessibility expert has reviewed the design, the label could be visually hidden but should still include an `aria-label` in HTML.\n\n#### Ensure proper association\n\nThe `for` attribute of the field label should match the `id` attribute of the associated input element to ensure proper association for screen readers and other assistive technologies.\n\n#### Keep labels concise\n\nUse a short, descriptive label (1-3 words) for the information that users need to provide. Supplementary information or requirements should be shown in help text below the field, not in the label.\n\n#### Use sentence case\n\nFollowing Adobe's UX writing style, field labels should be written in sentence case unless they contain words that are branded terms.\n\n#### Don't add a colon at the end of a field label\n\nThe design of the component already communicates the relationship between the label and the input field, so a colon is unnecessary.\n\n#### Mark only required or only optional fields, not both\n\nIn a single form, mark only the required fields or only the optional fields, depending on whichever is less frequent in the entire form. This reduces visual noise and makes the form easier to understand."

When a description is present and an error is triggered, it is replaced with an error message. Once the error is resolved, the help text description reappears.\n\nSince one gets replaced by the other, the language of the help text description and the error need to work together to convey the same messaging. The description text explains the requirements or adds supplementary context for how to successfully interact with a component. The error message text tells a user how to fix the error by re-stating the interaction requirements. Make sure that the help text description and error message include the same essential information so that it isn’t lost if one replaces the other.\n\nCommunicate error messages in a human-centered way by guiding a user and showing them a solution — don’t simply state what’s wrong and then leave them guessing as to how to resolve it. Ambiguous error messages can be frustrating and even shame-inducing for users. Also, keep in mind that something that a system may deem an error may not actually be perceived as an error to a user.\n\nFor help text, usually the error is related to something that needs to be fixed for in-line validation, so a [helpful tone](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/voice-and-tone/#Tone) is most appropriate. For example, if someone were to miss filling out a required field that asks for their email address, write the error text like you’re offering a hint or a tip to help guide them to understand what needs to go in the missing field: “Enter your email address.”\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"negative\">Password</sp-field-label>\n<sp-textfield id=\"negative\" type=\"password\" required invalid>\n    <sp-help-text slot=\"help-text\">\n        Create a password with at least 8 characters.\n    </sp-help-text>\n    <sp-help-text variant=\"negative\" slot=\"help-text-negative\">\n        Passwords must be at least 8 characters\n    </sp-help-text>\n</sp-textfield>\n```\n\n##### Icon\n\nWhen associated with content that does not supply an icon outlining the presence of an error, use the `icon` attribute to display one as part of the `<sp-help-text>` element.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-group horizontal id=\"fruit\">\n    <sp-checkbox value=\"apple\">Apple</sp-checkbox>\n    <sp-checkbox\n        value=\"not-a-fruit\"\n        onchange=\"javascript:this.parentElement.invalid = this.checked\"\n    >\n        Lettuce\n    </sp-checkbox>\n    <sp-checkbox value=\"strawberry\" checked>Strawberry</sp-checkbox>\n    <sp-help-text slot=\"help-text\">One of these is not a fruit.</sp-help-text>\n    <sp-help-text icon slot=\"negative-help-text\" icon>\n        Choose actual fruit(s).\n    </sp-help-text>\n</sp-field-group>\n```\n\n#### Disabled\n\nWhen the content associated to the element is disabled, use the `disabled` attribute to match the delivery of the `<sp-help-text>` element to that content.\n\n```html demo\n<sp-field-label for=\"color\" disabled>Color</sp-field-label>\n<sp-combobox id=\"color\" disabled>\n    <sp-menu-item value=\"red\">Red</sp-menu-item>\n    <sp-menu-item value=\"green\">Green</sp-menu-item>\n    <sp-menu-item value=\"blue\">Blue</sp-menu-item>\n    <sp-help-text slot=\"help-text\" disabled>\n        Choose or add at least one color.\n    </sp-help-text>\n</sp-combobox>\n```\n\n### Accessibility\n\n#### Be descriptive\n\nGood, descriptive help text includes 1-2 short sentences of information such as:\n\n-   An overall description of an input field or controls\n-   Hints for what kind of information needs to be inputted or selected\n-   Specific formatting examples or requirements\n\n#### Ensure help text and field share the same root\n\nIt is [not currently possible](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents-cg/#cross-root-aria) to provide accessible ARIA references between elements in different shadow roots. To ensure proper association between elements, help text must be included via the `slot=\"help-text\"` or `slot=\"help-text-negative\"` in an `<sp-text-field>`, `<sp-field-group>`, `<sp-combobox>` or `<sp-picker>`.\n\nTo add help text to your own custom element, see [Help Text Mixin](./help-text-mixin/)."

When not present, `<sp-icon>` will subsequently check for its `src` attribute which could populate the icon via an image, and then fallback to any slotted content for an element based icon.\n\n### Usage\n\n[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/icon?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/icon)\n[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/icon?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/icon)\n\n```\nyarn add @spectrum-web-components/icon\n```\n\nImport the side effectful registration of `<sp-icon>` via:\n\n```\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/icon/sp-icon.js';\n```\n\nWhen looking to leverage the `Icon` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:\n\n```\nimport { Icon } from '@spectrum-web-components/icon';\n```\n\n### Example\n\nNames of the icons on this page are provided by the [`<sp-icons-medium>` icon set](components/icons). Learn how to create your own via [`sp-iconset`](components/iconset).\n\n```html\n<sp-icons-medium></sp-icons-medium>\n<sp-icon name=\"ui:Arrow100\"></sp-icon>\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### Sizes\n\nIcons are available in various sizes in Spectrum ranging from `s` to `xxl`. By default an `sp-icon` without a `size` attribute will appear as if it were `size=\"m\"`. We can specify the size via `size` attribute.\n\n```html\n<sp-icon size=\"s\" name=\"ui:Arrow100\"></sp-icon>\n<sp-icon size=\"m\" name=\"ui:Arrow100\"></sp-icon>\n<sp-icon size=\"l\" name=\"ui:Arrow100\"></sp-icon>\n<sp-icon size=\"xl\" name=\"ui:Arrow100\"></sp-icon>\n<sp-icon size=\"xxl\" name=\"ui:Arrow100\"></sp-icon>\n```\n\n#### Icon colors\n\nIcons apply their color as `currentColor`, so change the `color` property of the element for customization.\n\n```html\n<sp-icon name=\"ui:Arrow100\" style=\"color: red;\"></sp-icon>\n```\n\n#### Image icon\n\nAn image icon can be supplied via the `src` attribute. Remember that you cannot style the contents of an image via CSS, so use graphics that are appropriate for your application's design requirements.\n\n```html\n<sp-icon\n    label=\"Previous\"\n    src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9Ii0yOTU3Ljk5NSAtNTUzMC4wMzIgNiAxMCI+PGRlZnM+PHN0eWxlPi5he2ZpbGw6bm9uZTtzdHJva2U6IzE0NzNlNjtzdHJva2UtbGluZWNhcDpyb3VuZDtzdHJva2UtbGluZWpvaW46cm91bmQ7c3Ryb2tlLW1pdGVybGltaXQ6MTA7c3Ryb2tlLXdpZHRoOjJweDt9PC9zdHlsZT48L2RlZnM+PHBhdGggY2xhc3M9ImEiIGQ9Ik0yNTEuMywzMzNsNC00LTQtNCIgdHJhbnNmb3JtPSJ0cmFuc2xhdGUoLTI3MDEuNjk1IC01MTk2LjAzMikgcm90YXRlKDE4MCkiLz48L3N2Zz4=\"\n></sp-icon>\n```\n\n#### HTML/SVG Element icon\n\nIcons can also be supplied via HTML elements and are applied via the default `<slot>`.\n\n```html\n<sp-icon>\n    <svg\n        xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n        viewBox=\"0 0 22 22\"\n        role=\"img\"\n        fill=\"currentColor\"\n        height=\"18\"\n        width=\"18\"\n        aria-hidden=\"true\"\n    >\n        <path\n            d=\"M19.75,10.04h-15l5.97-5.97a.483.483,0,0,0,0-.7l-.35-.36a.513.513,0,0,0-.71,0L2.24,10.44a.513.513,0,0,0,0,.71l7.39,7.84a.513.513,0,0,0,.71,0l.35-.35a.513.513,0,0,0,0-.71L4.76,11.5H19.75a.25.25,0,0,0,.25-.25v-.96A.25.25,0,0,0,19.75,10.04Z\"\n        ></path>\n    </svg>\n</sp-icon>\n```\n\n### Accessibility\n\nIf no meaning is lost by visually hiding an icon, it is considered decorative. Decorative icons should not have a label and should be hidden from assistive technology. `aria-hidden` is set to true by default for icons.\n\nIf an icon does add meaning, a label is required. Use the `label` attribute to set the label's text as the `aria-label` of the icon and remove the `aria-hidden` attribute.\n\n```html\n<sp-icon name=\"ui:Arrow100\" label=\"Arrow pointing to the right\"></sp-icon>\n```"

Using a technique that ensures only the icons actually leveraged in your application are present in your build, like UI Icons (../icons-ui/) or Workflow Icons (../icons-workflow/), will ensure smaller bundles and higher performance for you visitor. For non-Spectrum icons, you can still slot SVG and image content into an [`sp-icon` element](../icon/) or sanitize the SVG to a template literal so that it can be returned from the `render()` method in an extension of `IconBase` to create your own named icon element.\n\n### Accessibility\n\nReview the accessibility guidelines for the [icon](../icon#accessibility-guidelines)."

The stepper UI can be hidden using the `hide-stepper` attribute.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label>\n    What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"anatomy\"\n    format-options='{\n        \"style\": \"unit\",\n        \"unit\": \"MPH\",\n        \"unitDisplay\": \"long\"\n    }'\n></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### Sizes\n\n<sp-tabs selected=\"m\" auto label=\"Size Attribute Options\">\n<sp-tab value=\"s\">Small</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"s\">\n\n```html\n<sp-number-field label=\"Size\" value=\"1024\" size=\"s\"></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"m\">Medium</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"m\">\n\n```html\n<sp-number-field label=\"Size\" value=\"1024\" size=\"m\"></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"l\">Large</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"l\">\n\n```html\n<sp-number-field label=\"Size\" value=\"1024\" size=\"l\"></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"xl\">Extra Large</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"xl\">\n\n```html\n<sp-number-field label=\"Size\" value=\"1024\" size=\"xl\"></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n</sp-tabs>\n\n#### Formatting\n\nAn `<sp-number-field>` element will process its numeric value with `new Intl.NumberFormat(this.resolvedLanguage, this.formatOptions).format(this.value)` in order to prepare it for visual delivery in the input. In order to customize this processing supply your own `Intl.NumberFormatOptions` via the `formatOptions` property, or `format-options` attribute as seen below.\n\n`this.resolvedLanguage` represents the language in which the `<sp-number-field>` element is currently being delivered. By default, this value will represent the language established by the `lang` attribute on the root `<html>` element while falling back to `navigator.language` when that is not present. This value can be customized via a language context provided by a parent element that listens for the `sp-language-context` event and supplies update language settings to the `callback` function contained therein. Applications leveraging the [`<sp-theme>`](./components/theme) element to manage the visual delivery or text direction of their content will be also be provided a reactive context for supplying language information to its descendants.\n\n<sp-tabs selected=\"decimals\" auto label=\"Number Formatting\">\n<sp-tab value=\"decimals\">Decimals</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"decimals\">\n\nThe following example uses the `signDisplay` option to include the plus sign for positive numbers, for example to display an offset from some value. In addition, it always displays a minimum of 1 digit after the decimal point, and allows up to 2 fraction digits. If the user enters more than 2 fraction digits, the result will be rounded.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"decimals\">Adjust exposure</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"decimals\"\n    value=\"0\"\n    format-options='{\n        \"signDisplay\": \"exceptZero\",\n        \"minimumFractionDigits\": 1,\n        \"maximumFractionDigits\": 2\n    }'\n></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"percentages\">Percentages</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"percentages\">\n\nThe `style: 'percent'` option can be passed to the `formatOptions` property to treat the value as a percentage. In this mode, the value is multiplied by 100 before it is displayed, i.e. `0.45` is displayed as \"45%\". The reverse is also true: when the user enters a value, the `change` event will be triggered with the entered value divided by 100. When the percent option is enabled, the default step automatically changes to 0.01 such that incrementing and decrementing occurs by 1%. This can be overridden with the step property.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"percents\">Sales tax</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"percents\"\n    value=\"0.05\"\n    format-options='{\n        \"style\": \"percent\"\n    }'\n></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"currency\">Currency values</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"currency\">\n\nThe `style: 'currency'` option can be passed to the `formatOptions` property to treat the value as a currency value. The `currency` option must also be passed to set the currency code (e.g. `USD`) to use. In addition, the `currencyDisplay` option can be used to choose whether to display the currency `symbol`, currency `code`, or currency `name`. Finally, the `currencySign` option can be set to `accounting` to use accounting notation for negative numbers, which uses parentheses rather than a minus sign in some locales.\n\nIf you need to allow the user to change the currency, you should include a separate dropdown next to the `sp-number-field`. The `sp-number-field` itself will not determine the currency from the user input.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"currency\">Transaction amount</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"currency\"\n    value=\"45\"\n    format-options='{\n        \"style\": \"currency\",\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\",\n        \"currencyDisplay\": \"code\",\n        \"currencySign\": \"accounting\"\n    }'\n></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"units\">Units</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"units\">\n\nThe `style: 'unit'` option can be passed to the `formatOptions` property to format the value with a unit of measurement. The `unit` option must also be passed to set which unit to use (e.g. `inch`). In addition, the `unitDisplay` option can be used to choose whether to display the unit in `long`, `short`, or `narrow` format.\n\nIf you need to allow the user to change the unit, you should include a separate dropdown next to the number field. The number field itself will not determine the unit from the user input.\n\nNote: The unit style is not currently supported in Safari. A [polyfill](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-numberformat/) may be necessary.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"units\">Package width</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"units\"\n    value=\"4\"\n    format-options='{\n        \"style\": \"unit\",\n        \"unit\": \"inch\",\n        \"unitDisplay\": \"long\"\n    }'\n></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"custom-units\">Custom Units</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"custom-units\">\n\nWhile `Intl.NumberFormatOptions` does support a [wide range of units](https://tc39.es/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat/section6/locales-currencies-tz_proposed_out.html#sec-issanctionedsimpleunitidentifier), it is possible to encounter units (e.g. the graphics units of `pixel`, `pixels`, `points`, etc.) that are not supported therein. When this occurs, an `<sp-number-field>` element will attempt to polyfill support for this unit. See the following example delivering `{ style: \"unit\", unit: \"px\" }` below:\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"units\">Document width in pixels</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"units\"\n    value=\"500\"\n    format-options='{\n        \"style\": \"unit\",\n        \"unit\": \"px\"\n    }'\n></sp-number-field>\n```\n\nNote: the polyfilling done here is very simplistic and is triggered by supplying options that would otherwise cause the `Intl.NumberFormat()` call to throw an error. Once the unsupporting unit of `px` causes the construction of the object to throw, a back up formatter/parser pair will be created without the supplied unit data. When the `style` is set to `unit`, the `unit` value of will be adopted as the _static_ unit display. This means that neither pluralization or translation will be handled within the `<sp-number-field>` element itself. If pluralization or translation is important to the delivered interface, please be sure to handle passing those strings into to element via the `formatOptions` property reactively to the value of the element or locale of that page in question.\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"min-max\">Minimum and maximum values</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"min-max\">\n\nThe `min` and `max` properties can be used to limit the entered value to a specific range. The value will be clamped when the user commits the value to the `<sp-number-field>` element. In addition, the increment and decrement buttons will be disabled when the value is within one step value from the bounds. Ranges can be open ended by only providing a value for either `min` or `max` rather than both.\n\nIf a valid range is known ahead of time, it is a good idea to provide it to `<sp-number-field>` so it can optimize the experience. For example, when the minimum value is greater than or equal to zero, it is possible to use a numeric keyboard on iOS rather than a full text keyboard (necessary to enter a minus sign).\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"red\">Red value</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field id=\"red\" value=\"4\" min=\"0\" max=\"255\"></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n<sp-tab value=\"step\">Step values</sp-tab>\n<sp-tab-panel value=\"step\">\n\nThe step prop can be used to snap the value to certain increments. If there is a `min` defined, the steps are calculated starting from that minimum value. For example, if `min === 2`, and `step === 3`, the valid step values would be 2, 5, 8, 11, etc. If no `min` is defined, the steps are calculated starting from zero and extending in both directions. In other words, such that the values are evenly divisible by the step. A step can be any positive decimal. If no step is defined, any decimal value may be typed, but incrementing and decrementing snaps the value to an integer.\n\nIf the user types a value that is between two steps and blurs the input, the value will be snapped to the nearest step. When incrementing or decrementing, the value is snapped to the nearest step that is higher or lower, respectively. When incrementing or decrementing from an empty field, the value starts at the minValue or maxValue, respectively, if defined. Otherwise, the value starts from 0.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```html\n<sp-field-label\n    for=\"step\"\n>Step</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"step\"\n    step=\"10\"\n></sp-number-field>\n\n<sp-field-label\n    for=\"step-min\"\n>Step + min</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"step-min\"\n    min=\"2\"\n    step=\"3\"\n></sp-number-field>\n\n<sp-field-label\n    for=\"step-min-max\"\n>Step + min + max</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"step-min-max\"\n    min=\"2\"\n    max=\"21\"\n    step=\"3\"\n></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n</sp-tab-panel>\n</sp-tabs>\n\n### States\n\n#### Invalid\n\nThe `invalid` attribute indicates that the number field's value is invalid. When set, appropriate ARIA attributes will be automatically applied.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"invalid\">\n    It's one banana, Michael, how much could it cost?\n</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"invalid\"\n    invalid\n    style=\"width: 130px\"\n    value=\"10\"\n    min=\"0\"\n    max=\"0.3\"\n    step=\"0.01\"\n    format-options='{\n        \"style\": \"currency\",\n        \"currency\": \"USD\",\n        \"currencyDisplay\": \"code\",\n        \"currencySign\": \"accounting\",\n        \"minimumFractionDigits\": 2,\n        \"maximumFractionDigits\": 2\n    }'\n></sp-number-field>\n<sp-help-text variant=\"negative\">\n    Value should be between $0 and $0.3.\n</sp-help-text>\n```\n\n#### Valid\n\nThe `valid` attribute indicates that the number field's value is valid.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"valid\">\n    It's one banana, Michael, how much could it cost?\n</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field\n    id=\"valid\"\n    valid\n    style=\"width: 130px\"\n    value=\"0.23\"\n    min=\"0\"\n    max=\"0.3\"\n    step=\"0.01\"\n    format-options='{\n        \"style\": \"currency\",\n        \"currency\": \"USD\",\n        \"currencyDisplay\": \"code\",\n        \"currencySign\": \"accounting\",\n        \"minimumFractionDigits\": 2,\n        \"maximumFractionDigits\": 2\n    }'\n></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n#### Required\n\nUse the `required` attribute to indicate a number field value is required. Dictate the validity or invalidity state of the text entry with the `valid` or `invalid` attributes.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"number-1\" required>Count</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field id=\"number-1\" valid value=\"123\"></sp-number-field>\n<sp-field-label for=\"number-2\" required>Size</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field id=\"number-2\" invalid value=\"152\"></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n#### Disabled\n\nThe `disabled` attribute prevents the number field from receiving focus or events. The number field will appear faded.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"disabled\" disabled>Number of tickets</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field id=\"disabled\" disabled value=\"0\"></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n#### Read-only\n\nNumber fields have a `readonly` attribute for when they’re in the disabled state but still need their labels to be shown. This allows for content to be copied, but not interacted with or changed.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"readonly\">Number of tickets</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field id=\"readonly\" readonly value=\"0\"></sp-number-field>\n```\n\n### Behaviors\n\nThe number field works with the following interactions:\n\n- the input field,\n- <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd> or <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> keys,\n- the scroll wheel, or\n- the stepper UI, when not hidden by the `hide-stepper` attribute.\n\nThe input value incrementally increases or decreases by the value of the `step` attribute. The <kbd>shift</kbd> key can be used to apply steps at 10 times (or the value of the `step-modifier` attribute times) their normal rate.\n\n#### Default value\n\nThe `<sp-number-field>` component doesn't manage a default value by itself. This means that consumers can set the value of the number-field as an empty string by clearing the input. If we want the number-field to reset to a `default-value` when the user clears the input, we can listen for the `change` event on the number-field component and set its value to the desired `default-value` if the input is empty.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"default\">\n    Default value of this number field is 42\n</sp-field-label>\n<sp-number-field id=\"default\" value=\"20\"></sp-number-field>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n    const numberField = document.querySelector('#default');\n\n    numberField.addEventListener('change', (event) => {\n        alert('change');\n        const target = event.target;\n        if (isNaN(target.value)) {\n            target.value = '42';\n        }\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\n### Accessibility\n\n#### Labels\n\nEvery number field must have a label that clearly describes its purpose. The label can be provided either via the `label` attribute or with an associated `<sp-field-label>` element.\n\n#### Keyboard Navigation\n\nNumber fields support the following keyboard interactions:\n\n- <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd> and <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> keys increment and decrement the value\n- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd> or <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> applies steps at 10 times (or the value of `step-modifier`) the normal rate\n- The scroll wheel can be used to increment and decrement the value when focused\n\n#### Help Text\n\nConsider providing help text to explain:\n\n- The expected format of the input\n- Any minimum or maximum values\n- The meaning of units or special formatting (e.g., currency, percentages)\n- Step increments if they differ from the default\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n    customElements.whenDefined('sp-number-field').then(() => {\n        const numberField = document.querySelector('#default');\n\n        numberField.addEventListener('change', (event) => {\n            alert('change');\n            const target = event.target;\n            if (isNaN(target.value)) {\n                target.value = '42';\n            }\n        });\n    });\n</script>"

The method will step into any available `shadowRoot`s until it reaches the first element with no `shadowRoot` or no children available at the given coordinates.\n\n### Focusable\n\nThe `Focusable` subclass of `LitElement` adds some helpers method and lifecycle coverage in order to support passing focus to a container element inside of a custom element. The Focusable base class handles tabindex setting into shadowed elements automatically and is based heavily on the [aybolit delegate-focus-mixin](https://github.com/web-padawan/aybolit/blob/master/packages/core/src/mixins/delegate-focus-mixin.js).\n\n```javascript\nimport { Focusable } from '@spectrum-web-components/shared';\nimport { html } from 'lit-element';\n\nclass FocusableButton extends Focusable {\n    public static override get styles(): CSSResultArray {\n        return [...super.styles];\n    }\n    public get focusElement(): HTMLElement {\n        return this.shadowRoot.querySelector('#button') as HTMLElement;\n    }\n\n    protected override render(): TemplateResult {\n        return html`\n            <button\n                id=\"button\"\n            >\n                Focus for this button is being managed by the focusable base class.\n            </button>\n        `;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### FocusVisiblePolyfillMixin\n\nUse this mixin if you would like to leverage `:focus-visible` based selectors in your CSS. [Learn more about the polyfill that powers this.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/focus-visible)\n\n### getActiveElement\n\nUse this helper to find an `activeElement` in your component. [Learn more about tracking active elements over shadow DOM boundaries.](https://dev.to/open-wc/mind-the-document-activeelement-2o9a)\n\n### LikeAnchor\n\nMix `download`, `label`, `href`, and `target` properties into your element to allow it to act more like an `HTMLAnchorElement`.\n\n### ObserveSlotPresence\n\nWhen working with styles that are driven by the conditional presence of `<slot>`s in a component's shadow DOM, you will need to track whether light DOM that is meant for that slot exists. Use the `ObserveSlotPresence` mixin to target specific light DOM to observe the presence of and trigger `this.requestUpdate()` calls when content fulfilling that selector comes in and out of availability.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ObserveSlotPresence } from '@spectrum-web-components/shared';\nimport { LitElement, html } from 'lit-element';\nclass ObserveSlotPresenceElement extends ObserveSlotPresence(LitElement, '[slot=\"conditional-slot\"]') {\n    // translate the mixin properties into locally understandable language\n    protected get hasConditionalSlotContent() {\n        return this.slotContentIsPresent;\n    }\n    protected override render(): TemplateResult {\n        return html`\n            <button\n                id=\"button\"\n            >\n                ${this.hasConditionalSlotContent\n                    ? html`\n                        <slot\n                            name=\"conditional-slot\"\n                        ></slot>\n                    `\n                    : html``\n                }\n            </button>\n        `;\n    }\n    protected updated(): void {\n        console.log(this.slotContentIsPresent); // => true when <observing-slot-presence-element><div slot=\"conditional-slot\"></div></observing-slot-presence-element>\n    }\n}\ncustomElements.define('observing-slot-presence-element', ObserveSlotPresenceElement);\n```\n\n### ObserveSlotText\n\nWhen working with `<slot>`s and their `slotchange` event, you will have the opportunity to capture when the nodes and/or elements in your element are added or removed. However, if the `textContent` of a text node changes, you will not receive the `slotchange` event because the slot hasn't actually received new nodes and/or elements in the exchange. When working with a lit-html binding `<your-element>${text}</your-element>` that means you will not receive a `slotchange` event when the value of `text` goes from `text = ''` to `text = 'something'` or the other way. In these cases the `ObserveSlotText` can be leverages to apply a mutation observe onto your element that tracks `characterData` mutations so that you can resspond as desired.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ObserveSlotText } from '@spectrum-web-components/shared';\nimport { LitElement, html } from 'lit-element';\n\nclass ObserveSlotTextElement extends ObserveSlotText(LitElement, '#observing-slot') {\n    protected override render(): TemplateResult {\n        return html`\n            <button\n                id=\"button\"\n            >\n                <slot\n                    id=\"observing-slot\"\n                    @slotchange=${this.manageObservedSlot}\n                ></slot>\n            </button>\n        `;\n    }\n    protected updated(): void {\n        console.log(this.slotHasContent); // => true when <observing-slot-text-element>Text</observing-slot-text-element>\n    }\n}\n\ncustomElements.define('observing-slot-text-element', ObserveSlotTextElement);\n```"

Too many quiet components in a small space can be hard to read.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"name-3\">Name (quietly)</sp-field-label>\n<sp-textfield id=\"name-3\" placeholder=\"Enter your name\" quiet></sp-textfield>\n```\n\n### States\n\nUse the `required` attribute to indicate a textfield value is required. Dictate the validity or invalidity state of the text entry with the `valid` or `invalid` attributes.\n\n```html\n<sp-field-label for=\"name-1\" required>Name</sp-field-label>\n<sp-textfield\n    id=\"name-1\"\n    placeholder=\"Enter your name\"\n    valid\n    value=\"My Name\"\n></sp-textfield>\n<br />\n<sp-field-label for=\"name-2\" required>Name</sp-field-label>\n<sp-textfield id=\"name-2\" invalid placeholder=\"Enter your name\"></sp-textfield>\n```\n\n### Accessibility\n\n#### Include a label\n\nEvery text field should have a label. A field without a label is ambiguous and not accessible.\n\n#### Include help text\n\nThe description in the help text is flexible and encompasses a range of guidance. Sometimes this guidance is about what to input, and sometime it’s about how to input. This includes information such as:\n\n- An overall description of the input field\n- Hints for what kind of information needs to be input\n- Specific formatting examples or requirements\n\nLearn more about [using help text](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/text-field/#Use-help-text-to-show-hints,-formatting,-and-requirements).\n\n#### Include negative help text\n\nWrite error messaging in a human-centered way by guiding a user and showing them a solution — don’t simply state what’s wrong and then leave them guessing as to how to resolve it. Ambiguous error messages can be frustrating and even shame-inducing for users. Also, keep in mind that something that a system may deem an error may not actually be perceived as an error to a user.\n\nLearn more about [writing error messages](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/text-field/#Write-error-text-that-shows-a-solution).\n\n#### Do not us a placeholder as a replacement for a label or help-text\n\nPutting instructions for how to complete an input, requirements, or any other essential information into placeholder text is not accessible. Once a value is entered, placeholder text is no longer viewable; if someone is using an automatic form filler, they will never get the information in the placeholder text.\n\nInstead, use the help text description to convey requirements or to show any formatting examples that would help user comprehension. If there's placeholder text and help text at the same time, it becomes redundant and distracting, especially if they're communicating the same thing."

The Spectrum design system provides four color themes (`lightest`, `light`, `dark`, and `darkest`) and two different scales (`medium` and `large`) to support desktop & mobile UI.\n\n### Usage\n\n[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/theme?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/theme)\n[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/theme?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/theme)\n\n```\nyarn add @spectrum-web-components/theme\n```\n\n#### Quick start\n\n```\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/sp-theme.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/src/themes.js';\n```\n\nThe above import statements do two things: the first will get you started using the `<sp-theme>` wrapper element, and the second includes all four (4) color options (`lightest`, `light`, `dark`, and `darkest`) and both (2) scale options (`medium` and `large`) for the Spectrum Classic theme. Having all of these options available together is the easiest way to get a handle on the theming possibilities offered by the package and empowers you to prototype and test various deliveries of your application. However, reserving the download and parse time for all of the variants may not be required for all applications. See the \"Advanced usage\" section below for instructions on tuning the performance of an application that leverages this package.\n\nBelow are more ways to import the different scale and color options individually, in case you didn't want to import all of them as we did above. You'll use these statements in combination with the side effectful registration import statement `import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/sp-theme.js'`.\n\nThe various Classic themes can be imported en masse, as in the example above:\n\n```\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/src/themes.js';\n```\n\nThe various Spectrum Express themes can also be imported en masse:\n\n```\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/src/express/themes.js';\n```\n\nOr you can import the themes and scales individually:\n\n```\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-darkest.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-dark.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-light.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-lightest.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/scale-medium.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/scale-large.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-darkest.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-dark.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-light.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-lightest.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/scale-medium.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/scale-large.js';\n```\n\nWhen looking to leverage the `Theme` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:\n\n```\nimport { Theme } from '@spectrum-web-components/theme';\n```\n\n## What it's doing\n\nVisually, all Spectrum Web Components are an expression of the design tokens specified by Spectrum, Adobe's design system. On the web, these tokens are made available as CSS Custom Properties. Using `sp-theme` as a parent element for your components ensures that those CSS Custom Properties can be leveraged by the elements within your application. This ensures consistent delivery of not only the color and scale you've specified in your particular instance, but for _all_ the other color, scale, and content direction specifications across Spectrum.\n\nAdditionally, the `sp-theme` element manages the content direction applied to the elements in its DOM scope. By default, an `sp-theme` element resolves its initial content direction from the value specified by its first `sp-theme` or `document` ancestor; otherwise, it uses the value `dir=\"ltr\"` if a content direction isn't present in those elements. When a value for `dir` is manually supplied to `sp-theme`, the default value is overridden. In all cases, though, `sp-theme` manages the `dir` value of its `SpectrumElement` descendents, unless another `sp-theme` element is placed into its scope and overrides that management.\n\nTo make the above concepts a little more concrete, take a look at the table below. Try selecting another `color` in the picker, and notice how that changes the values of the colors. The token names for the variables persist, but the RGB values under the hood change! Considering that `sp-theme` also manages all the other theme and size options, `sp-theme` reveals itself to be a pretty powerful component.\n\n<custom-vars-viewer id=\"color-tokens\"></custom-vars-viewer>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n    const varsViewer = document.querySelector('custom-vars-viewer');\n    const options = {\n        rootMargin: '20px'\n    }\n    const callback = async (entries, observer) => {\n        if (entries[0].intersectionRatio === 0) return;\n        import('@spectrum-web-components/custom-vars-viewer/custom-vars-viewer.js').then(() => {\n            const queryThemeEvent = new CustomEvent('sp-track-theme', {\n                bubbles: true,\n                composed: true,\n                detail: {\n                    callback: (color) => {\n                        varsViewer.themeColor = color.startsWith('light')\n                            ? 'light'\n                            : color;\n                    },\n                },\n                cancelable: true,\n            });\n            varsViewer.dispatchEvent(queryThemeEvent);\n        });\n        observer.disconnect();\n    }\n\n    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options);\n    observer.observe(varsViewer);\n</script>\n\nWhen you're ready to look into more advanced usage of the components and themes in your application, there are vanilla CSS implementations of these tokens available in the `@spectrum-web-components/styles` package.\n\n## Example\n\nAn `<sp-theme>` element expects a value for each of its `color` and `scale` attributes to be provided on the element. While not required, you can also use the `system` attribute to specify whether the theme you're using is Spectrum Classic (the default), Spectrum 2 (upcoming release) or Spectrum Express.\n\n```html\n<sp-theme\n    system=\"spectrum\"\n    color=\"light\"\n    scale=\"medium\"\n    style=\"background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100)\"\n>\n    <sp-button onclick=\"spAlert(this, 'Themed <sp-button> clicked!')\">\n        Click me!\n    </sp-button>\n</sp-theme>\n```\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nOnce you've moved beyond the prototype phase of an application, it is likely that you will only use one combination of `color` and `scale` in your application, and even if not, you'll likely benefit from lazily loading the variants you don't leverage by default. For single combination applications, or to power a _default_ theme, the following imports can be used to ensure only the code your application requires is loaded:\n\n### Classic\n\n```js\n/**\n * Power a site using\n *\n * <sp-theme\n *      system=\"spectrum\"\n *      color=\"darkest\"\n *      scale=\"large\"\n * >\n **/\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-darkest.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/scale-large.js';\n\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/sp-theme.js';\n```\n\n### Express\n\n```js\n/**\n * Power a site using\n *\n * <sp-theme\n *      system=\"express\"\n *      color=\"light\"\n *      scale=\"medium\"\n * >\n **/\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-light.js';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/scale-medium.js';\n\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/theme/sp-theme.js';\n```\n\nWhen subsequent theme variants are needed, you can ensure those are lazily loaded by leveraging dynamic imports via something like:\n\n```js\nconst themeElement = document.querySelector('sp-theme');\n\nconst updateTheme = async (color, scale) => {\n    Promise.all([\n        import(`@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-${color}.js`),\n        import(`@spectrum-web-components/theme/scale-${scale}.js`),\n    ]).then(() => {\n        themeElement.color = color;\n        themeElement.scale = scale;\n    });\n};\n\nupdateTheme('light', 'medium');\n```\n\nWhen bundling your application, be sure to consult the documentation of your bundler for the correct way to ensure proper packaging of the programatic dependency graph that this will create.\n\n## Light theme\n\n```html demo\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n    #example {\n        max-width: 500px;\n        padding: 3em;\n        background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100);\n        color: var(--spectrum-gray-800);\n    }\n\n    #buttons {\n        margin-top: 2em;\n    }\n</style>\n<sp-theme system=\"express\" color=\"light\" scale=\"medium\">\n    <hzn-app-stuff></hzn-app-stuff>\n</sp-theme>\n\n<express-app>\n    <hzn-app-stuff></hzn-app-stuff>\n</express-app>\n```\n\n## Dark theme\n\n```html demo\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n    #example {\n        max-width: 500px;\n        padding: 3em;\n        background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100);\n        color: var(--spectrum-gray-800);\n    }\n\n    #buttons {\n        margin-top: 2em;\n    }\n</style>\n<sp-theme system=\"express\" color=\"dark\" scale=\"large\">\n    <hzn-app-stuff></hzn-app-stuff>\n</sp-theme>\n\n<express-app>\n    <hzn-app-stuff></hzn-app-stuff>\n</express-app>\n```\n\n## Large scale\n\nThe large scale of `<sp-theme>` will switch to using Spectrum's larger mobile [Platform Scale](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/platform-scale/)\n\n```html demo\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n    #example {\n        max-width: 500px;\n        padding: 1em;\n        background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100);\n        color: var(--spectrum-gray-800);\n    }\n\n    #buttons {\n        margin-top: 2em;\n    }\n</style>\n<sp-theme color=\"darkest\" scale=\"large\">\n    <div id=\"example\">\n        <div>\n            <sp-slider\n                value=\"5\"\n                step=\"1\"\n                min=\"1\"\n                max=\"11\"\n                label=\"Volume\"\n                id=\"volume-slider\"\n            ></sp-slider>\n        </div>\n        <div><sp-switch>Overdrive</sp-switch></div>\n        <sp-button-group id=\"buttons\">\n            <sp-button variant=\"primary\">Cancel</sp-button>\n            <sp-button variant=\"accent\">Continue</sp-button>\n        </sp-button-group>\n    </div>\n</sp-theme>\n```\n\n## Embedding themes\n\nThere are a few cases where it is necessary to embed one theme within another.\nFor example, if you have an application that is using a dark theme with a left to right text direction that is\npreviewing or editing content that will be displayed in a light theme with a right to left text direction.\n\n```html\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n    #outer {\n        max-width: 500px;\n        padding: 1em;\n        background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100);\n        color: var(--spectrum-gray-800);\n    }\n\n    #inner {\n        margin-top: 2em;\n        padding: 1em;\n        background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100);\n        color: var(--spectrum-gray-800);\n    }\n\n    #buttons {\n        margin-top: 2em;\n    }\n</style>\n<sp-theme color=\"dark\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    <div id=\"outer\">\n        <div>\n            <sp-slider\n                value=\"5\"\n                step=\"1\"\n                min=\"1\"\n                max=\"11\"\n                label=\"Volume\"\n                id=\"volume-slider\"\n            ></sp-slider>\n        </div>\n        <div><sp-switch>Overdrive</sp-switch></div>\n        <sp-button-group id=\"buttons\">\n            <sp-button variant=\"primary\">Cancel</sp-button>\n            <sp-button variant=\"accent\">Continue</sp-button>\n        </sp-button-group>\n        <sp-theme color=\"light\" dir=\"rtl\">\n            <div id=\"inner\">\n                <div>\n                    <sp-slider\n                        value=\"5\"\n                        step=\"1\"\n                        min=\"1\"\n                        max=\"11\"\n                        label=\"Volume\"\n                        id=\"volume-slider\"\n                    ></sp-slider>\n                </div>\n                <div><sp-switch>Overdrive</sp-switch></div>\n                <sp-button-group id=\"buttons\">\n                    <sp-button variant=\"primary\">Cancel</sp-button>\n                    <sp-button variant=\"accent\">Continue</sp-button>\n                </sp-button-group>\n            </div>\n        </sp-theme>\n    </div>\n</sp-theme>\n```\n\n## Language Context\n\nThe `<sp-theme>` element provides a language context for its descendents in the DOM. Descendents can resolve this context by dispatching an `sp-language-context` DOM event and supplying a `callback(lang: string) => void` method in the `detail` entry of the Custom Event. These callbacks will be reactively envoked when the `lang` attribute on the `<sp-theme>` element is updated. This way, you can control the resolved language in [`<sp-number-field>`](../components/number-field), [`<sp-slider>`](./components/slider), and other elements in one centralized place.\n\n## System Context (private Beta API - subject to changes)\n\nThe <sp-theme> element provides a \"system\" context to its descendants in the DOM. This context indicates the Spectrum design system variant currently in use (e.g., 'spectrum', 'express', or 'spectrum-two').\n\n#### Consuming the System Context in Components\n\nComponents can consume the system context by using the `SystemResolutionController`. This controller encapsulates the logic for resolving the system context, allowing it to be integrated into any component in few steps.\n\n#### Steps to Consume the System Context:\n\n1. Import the `SystemResolutionController` and the necessary types:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n    SystemResolutionController,\n    systemResolverUpdatedSymbol,\n} from './SystemResolutionController.js';\nimport type { SystemVariant } from '@spectrum-web-components/theme';\n```\n\n2. Instantiate the `SystemResolutionController`:\n\n    In your component class, create an instance of SystemResolutionController, passing `this` as the host element.\n\n```ts\nexport class MyComponent extends LitElement {\n    private systemResolver = new SystemResolutionController(this);\n\n    // Rest of your component code...\n}\n```\n\n3. Respond to system context changes:\n\n    Override the `update` lifecycle method to detect changes in the system context using the `systemResolverUpdatedSymbol`.\n\n```ts\nprotected update(changes: Map<PropertyKey, unknown>): void {\n  super.update(changes);\n  if (changes.has(systemResolverUpdatedSymbol)) {\n    this.handleSystemChange();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Implement the handler for system changes:\n\n    Create a method that will be called whenever the system context changes. Use `this.systemResolver.system` to access the current system variant.\n\n```ts\nprivate handleSystemChange(): void {\n  const currentSystem: SystemVariant = this.systemResolver.system;\n  // Implement logic based on the current system variant.\n  // For example, update styles, states or re-render parts of the component.\n}\n```\n\n5. Use the system context in other parts of your component logic and/or template:\n\n    You can now use `this.systemResolver.system` anywhere in your component to adjust behavior or rendering based on the system variant.\n\n```ts\nrender() {\n  return html`\n    <div>\n      <!-- Use the system context in your rendering logic -->\n      Current system variant: ${this.systemResolver.system}\n    </div>\n  `;\n}\n```"

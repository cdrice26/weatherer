      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

## Overview

This package provides minimal implementations of `Element`, `HTMLElement`,
`EventTarget`, `Event`, `CustomEvent`, `CustomElementRegistry`, and
`customElements`, designed to be used when Server Side Rendering (SSR) web
components from Node, including Lit components.

## Usage

### Usage from Lit

Lit itself automatically imports these shims when running in Node, so Lit users
should typically not need to directly depend on or import from this package.

See the [lit.dev SSR docs](https://lit.dev/docs/ssr/overview/) for general
information about server-side rendering with Lit.

### Usage in other contexts

Other libraries or frameworks who wish to support SSR are welcome to also depend
on these shims. (This package is planned to eventually move to
`@webcomponents/ssr-dom-shim` to better reflect this use case). There are two
main patterns for providing access to these shims to users:

1. Assigning shims to `globalThis`, ensuring that assignment occurs before
   user-code runs.

2. Importing shims directly from the module that provides your base class, using
   the `node` [export
   condition](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports) to
   ensure this only happens when running in Node, and not in the browser.

Lit takes approach #2 for all of the shims except for `customElements`, `Event`
and `CustomEvent`, so that users who have imported `lit` are able to call
`customElements.define` or `new Event(...)`/`new CustomEvent(...)` in their
components from Node.

this module.

The `SpectrumElement` base class as created by mixing `SpectrumMixin` onto `LitElement` adopts `dir` values from the `document` at connection time with a fallback to `lrt`. In a TypeScript context, it also enforces the presence of `this.shadowRoot` on extending components.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/base?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/base)
[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/base?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/base)

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/base
```

When looking to leverage the `SpectrumElement` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```
import { SpectrumElement } from '@spectrum-web-components/base';

export MyElement extends SpectrumElement {}

```

Similarly the `SpectrumMixin` class factory mixin is available via:

```
import { SpectrumMixin } from '@spectrum-web-components/base';

export MyElement extends SpectrumMixin(HTMLElement) {}
```

### Features

#### `dir` management

With powerful CSS selectors like `:host(:dir(rtl))` and `:host-content([dir=rtl])` not yet enjoying cross-browser support, reliably delivering content in both "left to right" and "right to left" while relying on Shadow DOM means certain trade offs need to be made. While every custom element build from `SpectrumMixin` could have its `dir` attribute applied to manage this, doing so is not only a pain for apply, it's a pain to maintain over time. To support the flexibility to deliver content in both of these directions, elements built from `SpectrumMixin` will observe the `dir` attribute of either the `document` or a containing `sp-theme`. This will allow your sites and applications to manage content direction in a single place while also opening the possibility of having multiple content directions on the same page by scoping those content sections with `sp-theme` elements.

Placing a `dir` attribute on an element built from `SpectrumMixin` before attaching it to the DOM will prevent it from resolving the text direction value to a parent `sp-theme` or `document` element. Elements applied to the page in this way will also NOT participate in observing any such elements, so their `dir` values will remain as initialized regardless of changes in other parts of your documents. If you choose to leverage this, be aware that any child (in both light DOM and shadow DOM) of this element will need to have a `dir` attribute applied as well if you do not want it resolving to a parent `sp-theme` or `document` element itself. In this way, it is likely that you would benefit from leveraging an `sp-theme` element to create scope in your document for managing this custom content direction section of your page.

#### `isLTR`

While CSS offers many powerful solutions for styling content in various directions, sometimes JS functionality depends on the specific of that direction. Elements built from `SpectrumMixin` have the `this.isLTR` getter that will resolve to `true` when `dir === 'ltr'`.

#### public shadowRoot!: ShadowRoot;

Elements built from `SpectrumMixin` assume that you will be using shadow DOM in the resulting custom element. To simplify TypeScript usage the presence of `this.shadowRoot` is asserted as non-null so that you have direct access to it without extended type checking.

An `<sp-button>` represents an action a user can take. sp-buttons can be clicked
or tapped to perform an action or to navigate to another page. Buttons in
Spectrum have several variations for different uses and multiple levels of
loudness for various attention-getting needs.

### Usage

[![Try it on Stackblitz](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20it%20on-Stackblitz-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-rgg7nx1d)

```zsh
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/button
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-button>` as follows:

```ts
import '@spectrum-web-components/button/sp-button.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `Button` base classes as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```ts
import { Button } from '@spectrum-web-components/button';
```

### Anatomy

```html
<sp-button>Try me</sp-button>
```

#### Content

`<sp-button>` elements can be provided a visible label,
a label and an icon, or just an icon.

An icon is provided by placing an icon element in the `icon` slot.

If the button is `icon-only`, a non-visible label
can be provided via the `label` attribute on an `<sp-button>`
or on an `<sp-icon*>` element child to appropriately
fulfill the accessibility contract of the button.

#### Variants

There are many button variants to choose from in Spectrum. The `variant`
attribute defaults to `accent`, but also accepts the following value: `accent`, `primary`, `secondary`, `negative`. They display as follows:

<sp-tabs selected="accent" auto label="Variant Attribute Options">
<sp-tab value="accent">Accent</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="accent">

```html demo
<sp-button-group style="min-width: max-content">

#### Treatment

The `treatment` attribute accepts `fill` and `outline` as values, and defaults to `fill`. These display as follows:

<sp-tabs selected="fill" auto label="Treatment Attribute Options">
<sp-tab value="fill">Fill</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="fill">

```html demo
<sp-button-group style="min-width: max-content">

    </sp-button>
</sp-button-group>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

### States

In addition to the variant, `<sp-button>` elements support two different visual states, disabled and pending, which can be applied by adding the attribute `disabled` or `pending` respectively. All `<sp-button>` variants support these states.

#### Disabled

While disabled, `<sp-button>` elements will not respond to click events and will appear faded.

```html
<sp-button-group>
    <sp-button variant="primary">Normal</sp-button>
    <sp-button variant="primary" disabled>Disabled</sp-button>
</sp-button-group>
```

#### Pending

While in pending state, `<sp-button>` elements will not respond to click events and will appear faded with an indeterminate `<sp-progress-circle>`.
The `<sp-button>` element's label and icon will be hidden while in pending state.

Note: The pending state of the `<sp-button>` element is applied after a 1s delay to avoid flashing the pending state for quick actions. You can override the delay by adding custom css var `--pending-delay` to your css.

```html
<sp-button-group>
    <sp-button variant="primary">Normal</sp-button>
    <sp-button variant="primary" pending>Pending</sp-button>
</sp-button-group>
```

### Behaviors

#### Handling events

Events handlers for clicks and other user actions can be registered on a
`<sp-button>` as one would on a standard HTML `<button>` element.

```html
<sp-button onclick="spAlert(this, '<sp-button> clicked!')">Click me</sp-button>
```

In addition to handling events like a native `<button>` HTML element, one can also use a `<sp-button>` in place of the `<a>` HTML element by using the `href` and optional `target` attribute.

```html demo
<sp-button
    href="https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components"
    target="_blank"
>
    Click me
</sp-button>
```

#### Autofocus

The `autofocus` attribute sets focus on the `<sp-button>` when the component
mounts. This is useful for setting focus to a specific sp-button when a
popover or dialog opens.

```html
<sp-button id="trigger">Open</sp-button>
<sp-overlay trigger="trigger@click" placement="bottom">
    <sp-popover>
        <!-- Button will autofocus when open -->
        <sp-button autofocus>Confirm</sp-button>
    </sp-popover>
</sp-overlay>
```

### Accessibility

#### Include a label

A button is required to have either a visible text label or a `label` attribute on either the `<sp-button>` itself
or on an `<sp-icon*>` element child.

#### Don't override color

Do not use custom colors for buttons. The colors of different button variations have been designed to be consistent and accessible.

#### Don't mix href and non-href buttons in a set of buttons

A screen reader user will not encounter href buttons when navigating by buttons or form controls. While they can both be used in the same page problems could occur if mixing the types in close proximity to each other.

#### Use static black or static white to contrast with backgrounds and images

To ensure maximum contrast with the background, use static black for light backgrounds and images, and static white for dark backgrounds and images. Avoid placing static components on top of busy images with a lot of variance in contrast.

<sp-tabs selected="black" auto label="Static variants for contrast">
<sp-tab value="black">Static black on light background</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="black">

```html demo
<div
    style="background-color: var(--spectrum-docs-static-black-background-color); padding: 20px"
>
    <sp-button static-color="black">Click me</sp-button>
    <sp-button static-color="black" treatment="outline">Click me</sp-button>
</div>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="white">Static white on dark background</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="white">

```html demo
<div
    style="background-color: var(--spectrum-docs-static-white-background-color); padding: 20px"
>
    <sp-button static-color="white">Click me</sp-button>
    <sp-button static-color="white" treatment="outline">Click me</sp-button>
</div>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

#### Clearly state the action

Make sure that a button’s label clearly states the outcome of the action. Use the same word or phrase as found elsewhere in the experience.

`<sp-checkbox>` allow users to select multiple items from a list of independent
options, or to mark an individual option as selected.

Should I use a checkbox or a switch? Use a switch when activating something
instead of selecting.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/checkbox?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/checkbox)
[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/checkbox?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/checkbox)
[![Try it on Stackblitz](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20it%20on-Stackblitz-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-31hvwr2m)

```bash
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/checkbox
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-checkbox>` via:

```ts
import '@spectrum-web-components/checkbox/sp-checkbox.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `Checkbox` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```ts
import { Checkbox } from '@spectrum-web-components/checkbox';
```

### Anatomy

A checkbox consists of a box that can be checked or unchecked, and a label that describes its purpose. The checkbox can also be in an indeterminate state, which is visually distinct from both checked and unchecked states.

### Options

#### Sizes

</sp-field-group>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

#### Variants

<sp-tabs selected="standard" auto label="Checkbox Variants">
<sp-tab value="standard">Standard Checkboxes</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="standard">

Standard checkboxes are the default style for checkboxes. They are optimal for
application panels where all visual elements are monochrome in order to direct
focus to the content.

```html
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 class="spectrum-Heading--subtitle1">Default</h4>
        <sp-checkbox>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox checked>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox indeterminate>Web component</sp-checkbox>
    </div>

    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 class="spectrum-Heading--subtitle1">Invalid</h4>
        <sp-checkbox invalid>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox checked invalid>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox indeterminate invalid>Web component</sp-checkbox>
    </div>

    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 class="spectrum-Heading--subtitle1">Disabled</h4>
        <sp-checkbox disabled>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox checked disabled>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox indeterminate disabled>Web component</sp-checkbox>
    </div>
</div>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="emphasized">Emphasized Checkboxes</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="emphasized">

Emphasized checkboxes are a secondary style for checkboxes. The blue color
provides a visual prominence that is optimal for forms, settings, lists or grids
of assets, etc. where the checkboxes need to be noticed.

```html
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 class="spectrum-Heading--subtitle1">Default</h4>
        <sp-checkbox emphasized>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox emphasized checked>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox emphasized indeterminate>Web component</sp-checkbox>
    </div>

    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 class="spectrum-Heading--subtitle1">Invalid</h4>
        <sp-checkbox emphasized invalid>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox emphasized checked invalid>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox emphasized indeterminate invalid>
            Web component
        </sp-checkbox>
    </div>

    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 class="spectrum-Heading--subtitle1">Disabled</h4>
        <sp-checkbox emphasized disabled>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox emphasized checked disabled>Web component</sp-checkbox>
        <sp-checkbox emphasized indeterminate disabled>
            Web component
        </sp-checkbox>
    </div>
</div>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

### States

#### Invalid

The `invalid` attribute indicates that the checkbox's value is invalid. When set, appropriate ARIA attributes will be automatically applied.

```html
<sp-checkbox invalid>Invalid</sp-checkbox>
```

#### Disabled

The `disabled` attribute prevents the checkbox from receiving focus or events. The checkbox will appear faded.

```html
<sp-checkbox disabled>Disabled</sp-checkbox>
```

#### Indeterminate

The `indeterminate` attribute sets the checkbox to an indeterminate state, visually distinct from both checked and unchecked states.

```html
<sp-checkbox indeterminate>Indeterminate</sp-checkbox>
```

#### Read-only

Checkboxes have a `readonly` attribute for when they’re in the disabled state but still need their labels to be shown. This allows for content to be copied, but not interacted with or changed.

```html
<sp-checkbox readonly>Read-only</sp-checkbox>
```

### Behaviors

#### Handling events

Event handlers for clicks and other user actions can be registered on an `<sp-checkbox>` as they would a standard `<input type="checkbox">` element.

```html
<sp-checkbox
    id="checkbox-example"
    onclick="spAlert(this, '<sp-checkbox> clicked!')"
>
    Check this box to see an onclick alert.
</sp-checkbox>
```

### Accessibility

Checkboxes are accessible by default, rendered in HTML using the `<input type="checkbox">` element. When the checkbox is set as `indeterminate` or
`invalid`, the appropriate ARIA state attribute will automatically be applied.

#### Include a label

Every checkbox must have a label that clearly describes its purpose. The label can be provided as content within the `<sp-checkbox>` element.

```html
<sp-checkbox>Send me text messages.</sp-checkbox>
```

#### Label groups of related checkboxes

Sets of checkboxes should always have a clear label that describes what the list of options represents and guides users what to do. This is important for accessibility, since a screen reader will read the label before each option. (See [field group's label documentation](/field-group/#label) for more information.)

```html
<sp-field-group label="Select your toppings">
    <sp-checkbox>Ketchup</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Mustard</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Pickles</sp-checkbox>
</sp-field-group>
```

#### Keyboard Navigation

Checkboxes can be toggled using the <kbd>Space</kbd> key when focused. They follow the standard tab order of the page.

#### Screen readers

Screen readers interpret checkboxes by announcing their role, label, current state, and role to the user. This allows users relying on assistive technology to understand and interact with the checkbox effectively.

When focused, a screen reader will announce:

- The label (text provided inside the or associated with it)
- The state: "checked", "not checked", or "partially checked" (when indeterminate is set)
- The role: "checkbox"
- If the checkbox is marked as invalid, it may also announce "invalid entry" depending on the screen reader.

An `<sp-field-group>` element is used to layout a group of fields, usually `<sp-checkbox>` elements. It can be leveraged for `vertical` or `horizontal` organization of the fields that are supplied as its children.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/field-group?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/field-group)
[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/field-group?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/field-group)

```zsh
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/field-group
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-field-group>` via:

```js
import '@spectrum-web-components/field-group/sp-field-group.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `FieldGroup` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```js
import { FieldGroup } from '@spectrum-web-components/field-group';
```

### Anatomy

```html
<sp-field-group horizontal label="Choose from horizontally placed options">
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 1</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 2</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox checked>Checkbox 3</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 4</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 5</sp-checkbox>
</sp-field-group>
```

#### Label

A field group must have a label in order to be accessible. A label can be provided either via the `label` attribute, like the previous example or with an `<sp-field-label>` element.

```html
<sp-field-label for="horizontal">
    Choose from horizontally placed options
</sp-field-label>
<sp-field-group horizontal id="horizontal">
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 1</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 2</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox checked>Checkbox 3</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 4</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 5</sp-checkbox>
</sp-field-group>
```

#### Help text

Help text can be accessibly associated with an `<sp-field-group>` element by using the `help-text` or `negative-help-text` slots. When using the `negative-help-text` slot, `<sp-field-group>` will self manage the presence of this content based on the value of the `invalid` property on your `<sp-field-group>` element. Content within the `help-text` slot will be show by default. When your `<sp-field-group>` should receive help text based on state outside of the complexity of `invalid` or not, manage the content addressed to the `help-text` from above to ensure that it displays the right messaging and possesses the right `variant`.

<sp-tabs selected="self" auto label="Help text usage in field groups">
<sp-tab value="self">Self managed</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="self">

```html
<sp-field-group horizontal id="self" label="What are your favorite fruits?">

            helpText.icon = this.checked;
            helpText.textContent = this.checked ? 'Choose actual fruit(s).' : 'One of these is not a fruit.';
            helpText.variant = this.checked ? 'negative' : 'neutral';
        "
    >
        Lettuce
    </sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox value="strawberry" checked>Strawberry</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-help-text slot="help-text">One of these is not a fruit.</sp-help-text>
</sp-field-group>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

### Options

#### Vertical

```html
<sp-field-label for="vertical">
    Choose from vertically placed options
</sp-field-label>
<sp-field-group vertical id="vertical">
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 1</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 2</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 3</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox>Checkbox 4</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox checked>Checkbox 5</sp-checkbox>
</sp-field-group>
```

### Accessibility

#### Include a label

Every field group should have a label. A field without a label is ambiguous and not accessible.

#### Include help text

The description in the help text is flexible and encompasses a range of guidance. Sometimes this guidance is about what to input, and sometime it’s about how to input. This includes information such as:

-   An overall description of the input field
-   Hints for what kind of information needs to be input
-   Specific formatting examples or requirements

Learn more about [using help text](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/text-field/#Use-help-text-to-show-hints,-formatting,-and-requirements).

#### Include negative help text

Write error messaging in a human-centered way by guiding a user and showing them a solution — don’t simply state what’s wrong and then leave them guessing as to how to resolve it. Ambiguous error messages can be frustrating and even shame-inducing for users. Also, keep in mind that something that a system may deem an error may not actually be perceived as an error to a user.

Learn more about [writing error messages](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/text-field/#Write-error-text-that-shows-a-solution).

#### Do not us a placeholder as a replacement for a label or help-text

Putting instructions for how to complete an input, requirements, or any other essential information into placeholder text is not accessible. Once a value is entered, placeholder text is no longer viewable; if someone is using an automatic form filler, they will never get the information in the placeholder text.

Instead, use the help text description to convey requirements or to show any formatting examples that would help user comprehension. If there's placeholder text and help text at the same time, it becomes redundant and distracting, especially if they're communicating the same thing.

An `<sp-field-label>` provides accessible labelling for form elements. Use the `for` attribute to outline the `id` of an element in the same DOM tree to which it should associate itself. Field labels give context to information that a user needs to input and are commonly used in forms to provide users with clear guidance about what information is required.

### Usage

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/field-label
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-field-label>` via:

```ts
import '@spectrum-web-components/field-label/sp-field-label.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `FieldLabel` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```ts
import { FieldLabel } from '@spectrum-web-components/field-label';
```

### Anatomy

Field labels can be associated with form elements by using the `for` attribute, which should reference the `id` of the related input element.

```html demo
<sp-field-label for="email">Email address</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield id="email" placeholder="user@adobe.com"></sp-textfield>
```

Field labels can also be used to label a group of related inputs:

```html demo
<sp-field-label for="account-type">Account type</sp-field-label>
<sp-radio-group id="account-type">
    <sp-radio value="admin">Admin</sp-radio>
    <sp-radio value="member" checked>Member</sp-radio>
    <sp-radio value="guest">Guest</sp-radio>
</sp-radio-group>
```

    id="lifestory-3"
    size="xl"
></sp-textfield>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

#### Label Position

Field labels can be positioned either on top of an input (default) or to the side of an input. The top position is recommended for most cases as it works better with long text, localization, and responsive layouts.

Using the `side-aligned` attribute will display the `<sp-field-label>` element inline with surrounding elements and the `start` and `end` values outline the alignment of the label text in the width specified.

<sp-tabs selected="top" auto label="Label position options">
<sp-tab value="top">Top (Default)</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="top">

```html demo
<sp-field-label for="country-top">Country</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield placeholder="Enter your country" id="country-top"></sp-textfield>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="side-start">Side (Start Aligned)</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="side-start">

Use `side-aligned="start"` to display the `<sp-field-label>` inline and to align the label text to the "start" of the flow of text:

```html demo
<sp-field-label for="lifestory-1" side-aligned="start" style="width: 120px">
    Life Story
</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield
    placeholder="Enter your life story"
    id="lifestory-1"
></sp-textfield>
<br />
<br />
<sp-field-label
    for="birth-place-1"
    side-aligned="start"
    required
    style="width: 120px"
>
    Birthplace
</sp-field-label>
<sp-picker id="birth-place-1">
    <span slot="label">Choose a location:</span>
    <sp-menu-item>Istanbul</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>London</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>Maputo</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>Melbourne</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>New York</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>San Francisco</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>Santiago</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>Tokyo</sp-menu-item>
</sp-picker>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="side-end">Side (End Aligned)</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="side-end">

Use `side-aligned="end"` to display the `<sp-field-label>` inline and to align the label text to the "end" of the flow of text:

```html demo
<sp-field-label
    for="lifestory-2"
    side-aligned="end"
    required
    style="width: 120px"
>
    Life Story
</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield
    placeholder="Enter your life story"
    id="lifestory-2"
></sp-textfield>
<br />
<br />
<sp-field-label for="birth-place-2" side-aligned="end" style="width: 120px">
    Birthplace
</sp-field-label>
<sp-picker id="birth-place-2">
    <span slot="label">Choose a location:</span>
    <sp-menu-item>Istanbul</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>London</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>Maputo</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>Melbourne</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>New York</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>San Francisco</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>Santiago</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item>Tokyo</sp-menu-item>
</sp-picker>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

#### Necessity Indicator

Field labels can indicate whether an input is required or optional. By default, required fields are marked with an asterisk icon.

<sp-tabs selected="required" auto label="Necessity indicator options">
<sp-tab value="required">Required (Icon)</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="required">

```html demo
<sp-field-label for="name-required" required>Full name</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield
    placeholder="Enter your full name"
    id="name-required"
    required
></sp-textfield>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="optional">Optional (Text)</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="optional">

```html demo
<sp-field-label for="description-optional">
    Profile description (optional)
</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield
    placeholder="Enter a description"
    id="description-optional"
></sp-textfield>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

### States

#### Disabled

When the associated input field is disabled, the field label should also be disabled.

```html demo
<sp-field-label for="disabled-field" disabled>Country</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield
    placeholder="Enter your country"
    id="disabled-field"
    disabled
></sp-textfield>
```

### Behaviors

#### Text Overflow

When a field label is too long for the available horizontal space, it wraps to form another line.

```html demo
<sp-field-label for="seminar-field" style="max-width: 200px">
    What you're hoping to learn from the seminar and any specific topics you'd
    like covered
</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield
    placeholder="Enter your expectations"
    id="seminar-field"
></sp-textfield>
```

### Accessibility

#### Always include a label

Every input should have a label. An input without a label is ambiguous and not accessible. In rare cases where context is sufficient and an accessibility expert has reviewed the design, the label could be visually hidden but should still include an `aria-label` in HTML.

#### Ensure proper association

The `for` attribute of the field label should match the `id` attribute of the associated input element to ensure proper association for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

#### Keep labels concise

Use a short, descriptive label (1-3 words) for the information that users need to provide. Supplementary information or requirements should be shown in help text below the field, not in the label.

#### Use sentence case

Following Adobe's UX writing style, field labels should be written in sentence case unless they contain words that are branded terms.

#### Don't add a colon at the end of a field label

The design of the component already communicates the relationship between the label and the input field, so a colon is unnecessary.

#### Mark only required or only optional fields, not both

In a single form, mark only the required fields or only the optional fields, depending on whichever is less frequent in the entire form. This reduces visual noise and makes the form easier to understand.

    </sp-help-text>
</sp-textfield>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

#### Negative

The negative variant of `<sp-help-text>` is used to convey error messages.

Help text displays either a description (the neutral variant) or an error message (the negative variant) in the same space. When a description is present and an error is triggered, it is replaced with an error message. Once the error is resolved, the help text description reappears.

Since one gets replaced by the other, the language of the help text description and the error need to work together to convey the same messaging. The description text explains the requirements or adds supplementary context for how to successfully interact with a component. The error message text tells a user how to fix the error by re-stating the interaction requirements. Make sure that the help text description and error message include the same essential information so that it isn’t lost if one replaces the other.

Communicate error messages in a human-centered way by guiding a user and showing them a solution — don’t simply state what’s wrong and then leave them guessing as to how to resolve it. Ambiguous error messages can be frustrating and even shame-inducing for users. Also, keep in mind that something that a system may deem an error may not actually be perceived as an error to a user.

For help text, usually the error is related to something that needs to be fixed for in-line validation, so a [helpful tone](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/voice-and-tone/#Tone) is most appropriate. For example, if someone were to miss filling out a required field that asks for their email address, write the error text like you’re offering a hint or a tip to help guide them to understand what needs to go in the missing field: “Enter your email address.”

```html
<sp-field-label for="negative">Password</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield id="negative" type="password" required invalid>
    <sp-help-text slot="help-text">
        Create a password with at least 8 characters.
    </sp-help-text>
    <sp-help-text variant="negative" slot="help-text-negative">
        Passwords must be at least 8 characters
    </sp-help-text>
</sp-textfield>
```

##### Icon

When associated with content that does not supply an icon outlining the presence of an error, use the `icon` attribute to display one as part of the `<sp-help-text>` element.

```html
<sp-field-group horizontal id="fruit">
    <sp-checkbox value="apple">Apple</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox
        value="not-a-fruit"
        onchange="javascript:this.parentElement.invalid = this.checked"
    >
        Lettuce
    </sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox value="strawberry" checked>Strawberry</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-help-text slot="help-text">One of these is not a fruit.</sp-help-text>
    <sp-help-text icon slot="negative-help-text" icon>
        Choose actual fruit(s).
    </sp-help-text>
</sp-field-group>
```

#### Disabled

When the content associated to the element is disabled, use the `disabled` attribute to match the delivery of the `<sp-help-text>` element to that content.

```html demo
<sp-field-label for="color" disabled>Color</sp-field-label>
<sp-combobox id="color" disabled>
    <sp-menu-item value="red">Red</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item value="green">Green</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item value="blue">Blue</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-help-text slot="help-text" disabled>
        Choose or add at least one color.
    </sp-help-text>
</sp-combobox>
```

### Accessibility

#### Be descriptive

Good, descriptive help text includes 1-2 short sentences of information such as:

-   An overall description of an input field or controls
-   Hints for what kind of information needs to be inputted or selected
-   Specific formatting examples or requirements

#### Ensure help text and field share the same root

It is [not currently possible](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents-cg/#cross-root-aria) to provide accessible ARIA references between elements in different shadow roots. To ensure proper association between elements, help text must be included via the `slot="help-text"` or `slot="help-text-negative"` in an `<sp-text-field>`, `<sp-field-group>`, `<sp-combobox>` or `<sp-picker>`.

To add help text to your own custom element, see [Help Text Mixin](./help-text-mixin/).

`<sp-icon>` renders an icon to the page. By default the `name` attribute will pair with separately registered icon sets to deliver the icons. When not present, `<sp-icon>` will subsequently check for its `src` attribute which could populate the icon via an image, and then fallback to any slotted content for an element based icon.

Icons are available in various sizes in Spectrum ranging from `s` to `xxl`. By default an `sp-icon` without a `size` attribute will appear as if it were `size="m"`. We can specify the size via `size` attribute.

```html
<sp-icon size="s" name="ui:Arrow100"></sp-icon>
<sp-icon size="m" name="ui:Arrow100"></sp-icon>
<sp-icon size="l" name="ui:Arrow100"></sp-icon>
<sp-icon size="xl" name="ui:Arrow100"></sp-icon>
<sp-icon size="xxl" name="ui:Arrow100"></sp-icon>
```

#### Icon colors

Icons apply their color as `currentColor`, so change the `color` property of the element for customization.

```html
<sp-icon name="ui:Arrow100" style="color: red;"></sp-icon>
```

#### Image icon

An image icon can be supplied via the `src` attribute. Remember that you cannot style the contents of an image via CSS, so use graphics that are appropriate for your application's design requirements.

```html
<sp-icon
    label="Previous"
    src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9Ii0yOTU3Ljk5NSAtNTUzMC4wMzIgNiAxMCI+PGRlZnM+PHN0eWxlPi5he2ZpbGw6bm9uZTtzdHJva2U6IzE0NzNlNjtzdHJva2UtbGluZWNhcDpyb3VuZDtzdHJva2UtbGluZWpvaW46cm91bmQ7c3Ryb2tlLW1pdGVybGltaXQ6MTA7c3Ryb2tlLXdpZHRoOjJweDt9PC9zdHlsZT48L2RlZnM+PHBhdGggY2xhc3M9ImEiIGQ9Ik0yNTEuMywzMzNsNC00LTQtNCIgdHJhbnNmb3JtPSJ0cmFuc2xhdGUoLTI3MDEuNjk1IC01MTk2LjAzMikgcm90YXRlKDE4MCkiLz48L3N2Zz4="
></sp-icon>
```

#### HTML/SVG Element icon

Icons can also be supplied via HTML elements and are applied via the default `<slot>`.

```html
<sp-icon>
    <svg
        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        viewBox="0 0 22 22"
        role="img"
        fill="currentColor"
        height="18"
        width="18"
        aria-hidden="true"
    >
        <path
            d="M19.75,10.04h-15l5.97-5.97a.483.483,0,0,0,0-.7l-.35-.36a.513.513,0,0,0-.71,0L2.24,10.44a.513.513,0,0,0,0,.71l7.39,7.84a.513.513,0,0,0,.71,0l.35-.35a.513.513,0,0,0,0-.71L4.76,11.5H19.75a.25.25,0,0,0,.25-.25v-.96A.25.25,0,0,0,19.75,10.04Z"
        ></path>
    </svg>
</sp-icon>
```

### Accessibility

If no meaning is lost by visually hiding an icon, it is considered decorative. Decorative icons should not have a label and should be hidden from assistive technology. `aria-hidden` is set to true by default for icons.

If an icon does add meaning, a label is required. Use the `label` attribute to set the label's text as the `aria-label` of the icon and remove the `aria-hidden` attribute.

```html
<sp-icon name="ui:Arrow100" label="Arrow pointing to the right"></sp-icon>
```

Deliver [Spectrum UI Icons](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/icons/) as either:

-   Registered custom elements (`<sp-icon-arrow75>`)
-   Unregistered class definitions (`IconArrow75`)
-   Functions with customizable template tags to be used across various frameworks (`Arrow75Icon()`)

Search a full list of icons to [find an icon](#find-an-icon) for your project or find technical information about [extended use cases](#extended-use-cases), like consuming this package in various UI frameworks below.

Remember to consult Spectrum's [Iconography Guidelines](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/iconography/) when planning how to leverage these icons in the visual delivery of your application.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui)
[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui)

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/icons-ui
```

Import the side effectful registration of a single element (e.g. `<sp-icon-arrow75>`) via:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui/icons/sp-icon-arrow75.js';
```

Leverage a single icon base class (e.g. `IconArrow75`) as a type, or for extension purposes, do so, via:

```
import { IconArrow75 } from '@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui/src/elements/IconArrow75.js';
```

### Find an icon

Search the available Spectrum Workflow icons below.

<p class="for-github">Complete search experience available at: <a href="https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/components/icons-ui/">https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/components/icons-ui/</a>.</p>

<icons-demo class="icon-search" package="icons-ui" size="xxl" name="ui"></icons-demo>

<script type="module">
const search = document.querySelector('.icon-search');
const options = {
  rootMargin: '20px'
}
const callback = async (entries, observer) => {
    if (entries[0].intersectionRatio === 0) return;
    import('@swc-packages-internal/iconset/stories/icons-demo.js');
    import('@swc-packages-internal/icons-ui/stories/icon-manifest.js').then(({iconManifest}) => {
        search.icons = iconManifest;
    });
    observer.disconnect();
}
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options);
observer.observe(search);
</script>

### Alternative usage

You can import raw icons (e.g. `Arrow75Icon()`) via:

```js
import { Arrow75Icon } from '@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui/src/icons/Arrow75.js';
```

`@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui` exports _all_ icons. If your build process [tree-shakes](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#tree-shaking) dependencies, you can import from it directly:

```js
import { Arrow75Icon } from '@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui';
```

These icon literals are prepared with the `html` template tag from `lit-html`, the default value of an icon export will be as follows:

```js
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit-element';
import '@spectrum-web-components/icon';
import { Arrow75Icon } from '@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui';

class ElementWithIcon extends LitElement {
    protected override render(): TemplateResult {
        return html`
            <sp-icon>
                ${Arrow75Icon()}
            </sp-icon>
        `
    }
}

customElements.define('element-with-icon', ElementWithIcon);
```

Every icons can be customized via the following options:

```js
{
    width: 24, // number outlining the width to deliver the SVG element with
    height: 24, // number outlining the height to delivery the SVG element with
    hidden: false, // boolean representing whether to apply the `aria-hidden` attribute
    title: 'Icon title', // string of the title to deliver the icon with
}
```

### Extended use cases

The default exports of this package are pre-wrapped via `setCustomTemplateLiteralTag` in the `html` template tag from `lit-html`, and work like the following::

```js
import { Arrow75Icon } from '@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui';

console.log(Arrow75Icon());

/***
TemplateResult {strings: Array[1], values: Array[0], type: "html", processor: DefaultTemplateProcessor, constructor: Object}
***/
```

When working in the context of other frameworks, it is possible to import the icons with a generic template tag as follows:

```js
import { Arrow75Icon } from '@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui/src/icons.js';

console.log(Arrow75Icon());

/***
<svg
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
    viewBox="0 0 36 36"
    role="img"
    fill="currentColor"
    height="24"
    width="24"
    aria-hidden="false"
    aria-label="Circle"
>
    <path
      d="M9.26 4.406L6.528 1.672A.84.84 0 005.34 2.859L6.64 4.16H1.396a.84.84 0 000 1.68H6.64l-1.301 1.3a.84.84 0 001.188 1.188l2.734-2.734a.84.84 0 000-1.188z"
    />
</svg>
***/
```

What's more, if you're already working with a specific parser in your project, you can assign it as the one to use when delivering the icons in order to be sure that the SVG content is delivered as parsed content to your final template. The means if you were working with Preact via the `htm` tag as bound to the provided hyperscript function:

```js
import {
    Arrow75Icon,
    setCustomTemplateLiteralTag,
} from '@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui/src/icons.js';
import htm from 'htm';
import { h } from 'preact';

const hPreact = htm.bind(h);

setCustomTemplateLiteralTag(hPreact);

console.log(Arrow75Icon());

/***
VNode {nodeName: "svg", children: Array[1], attributes: Object, key: undefined, constructor: Object}
***/
```

In this way, the icons exported by `@spectrum-web-components/icons-ui` can be leveraged in projects powered by the likes of hyperHTML, lighterhtml, lit-html, Preact, React, Vanilla JS, Vue.js, and more!

Extend either the `Iconset` or `IconsetSVG` exports of this package to supply your application with a custom icon set to power the use of `<sp-icon>` elements throughout. Give your new icon set a custom name, and you'll be ready to supply them as `<sp-icon name="custom-icons:icon">` across your application.

### Deprecated

Iconsets have been deprecated and will be removed from the project in an upcoming version. Using a technique that ensures only the icons actually leveraged in your application are present in your build, like UI Icons (../icons-ui/) or Workflow Icons (../icons-workflow/), will ensure smaller bundles and higher performance for you visitor. For non-Spectrum icons, you can still slot SVG and image content into an [`sp-icon` element](../icon/) or sanitize the SVG to a template literal so that it can be returned from the `render()` method in an extension of `IconBase` to create your own named icon element.

When composing complex form fields, an `<sp-infield-button>` can visually associate button functionality with other form fields to delivery enhanced capabilities to your visitors.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/infield-button?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/infield-button)

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/infield-button
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-infield-button>` via:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/infield-button/sp-infield-button.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `InfieldButton` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```
import { InfieldButton } from '@spectrum-web-components/infield-button';
```

## Inline buttons

Use the `inline` attribute to describe whether the `<sp-infield-button>` should be visually at the `start` or `end` of the field is associated to:

### inline="start"

```html
<sp-infield-button inline="start" label="Add">
    <sp-icon-add></sp-icon-add>
</sp-infield-button>
```

### inline="end"

```html
<sp-infield-button inline="end" label="Add">
    <sp-icon-add></sp-icon-add>
</sp-infield-button>
```

## Stacked buttons

The `block` attribute can be used to create a vertial stack of buttons. You can place buttons visually on the stack with the `start` or `end` values:

```html
<sp-infield-button block="start" label="Increment">
    <sp-icon-add size="xxs"></sp-icon-add>
</sp-infield-button>
<sp-infield-button block="end" label="Decrement">
    <sp-icon-remove size="xxs"></sp-icon-remove>
</sp-infield-button>
```

## Disabled

An `<sp-infield-button>` with the `disabled` attribute will become non-interactive and dimmed:

```html
<sp-infield-button disabled inline="start" label="Add">
    <sp-icon-add></sp-icon-add>
</sp-infield-button>
```

## Quiet

An `<sp-infield-button>` with the `quiet` attribute will feature a diminished visual presence:

```html
<sp-infield-button inline="start" label="Add" quiet>
    <sp-icon-add></sp-icon-add>
</sp-infield-button>
```

`<sp-number-field>` elements are used for numeric inputs.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/number-field?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/number-field)
[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/number-field?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/number-field)
[![Try it on Stackblitz](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20it%20on-Stackblitz-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-drmcfxlv)

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/number-field
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-number-field>` via:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/number-field/sp-number-field.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `NumberField` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```
import { NumberField } from '@spectrum-web-components/number-field';
```

### Anatomy

A number field consists of an input field for numeric values and optional stepper buttons for incrementing and decrementing the value. The stepper UI can be hidden using the `hide-stepper` attribute.

```html
<sp-field-label>
    What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field
    id="anatomy"
    format-options='{
        "style": "unit",
        "unit": "MPH",
        "unitDisplay": "long"
    }'
></sp-number-field>
```

### Options

#### Sizes

<sp-tabs selected="m" auto label="Size Attribute Options">
<sp-tab value="s">Small</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="s">

```html
<sp-number-field label="Size" value="1024" size="s"></sp-number-field>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="m">Medium</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="m">

```html
<sp-number-field label="Size" value="1024" size="m"></sp-number-field>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="l">Large</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="l">

```html
<sp-number-field label="Size" value="1024" size="l"></sp-number-field>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="xl">Extra Large</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="xl">

```html
<sp-number-field label="Size" value="1024" size="xl"></sp-number-field>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

#### Formatting

An `<sp-number-field>` element will process its numeric value with `new Intl.NumberFormat(this.resolvedLanguage, this.formatOptions).format(this.value)` in order to prepare it for visual delivery in the input. In order to customize this processing supply your own `Intl.NumberFormatOptions` via the `formatOptions` property, or `format-options` attribute as seen below.

`this.resolvedLanguage` represents the language in which the `<sp-number-field>` element is currently being delivered. By default, this value will represent the language established by the `lang` attribute on the root `<html>` element while falling back to `navigator.language` when that is not present. This value can be customized via a language context provided by a parent element that listens for the `sp-language-context` event and supplies update language settings to the `callback` function contained therein. Applications leveraging the [`<sp-theme>`](./components/theme) element to manage the visual delivery or text direction of their content will be also be provided a reactive context for supplying language information to its descendants.

<sp-tabs selected="decimals" auto label="Number Formatting">
<sp-tab value="decimals">Decimals</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="decimals">

The following example uses the `signDisplay` option to include the plus sign for positive numbers, for example to display an offset from some value. In addition, it always displays a minimum of 1 digit after the decimal point, and allows up to 2 fraction digits. If the user enters more than 2 fraction digits, the result will be rounded.

```html
<sp-field-label for="decimals">Adjust exposure</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field
    id="decimals"
    value="0"
    format-options='{
        "signDisplay": "exceptZero",
        "minimumFractionDigits": 1,
        "maximumFractionDigits": 2
    }'
></sp-number-field>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="percentages">Percentages</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="percentages">

The `style: 'percent'` option can be passed to the `formatOptions` property to treat the value as a percentage. In this mode, the value is multiplied by 100 before it is displayed, i.e. `0.45` is displayed as "45%". The reverse is also true: when the user enters a value, the `change` event will be triggered with the entered value divided by 100. When the percent option is enabled, the default step automatically changes to 0.01 such that incrementing and decrementing occurs by 1%. This can be overridden with the step property.

```html
<sp-field-label for="percents">Sales tax</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field
    id="percents"
    value="0.05"
    format-options='{
        "style": "percent"
    }'
></sp-number-field>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="currency">Currency values</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="currency">

The `style: 'currency'` option can be passed to the `formatOptions` property to treat the value as a currency value. The `currency` option must also be passed to set the currency code (e.g. `USD`) to use. In addition, the `currencyDisplay` option can be used to choose whether to display the currency `symbol`, currency `code`, or currency `name`. Finally, the `currencySign` option can be set to `accounting` to use accounting notation for negative numbers, which uses parentheses rather than a minus sign in some locales.

If you need to allow the user to change the currency, you should include a separate dropdown next to the `sp-number-field`. The `sp-number-field` itself will not determine the currency from the user input.

```html
<sp-field-label for="currency">Transaction amount</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field
    id="currency"
    value="45"
    format-options='{
        "style": "currency",
        "currency": "EUR",
        "currencyDisplay": "code",
        "currencySign": "accounting"
    }'
></sp-number-field>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="units">Units</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="units">

The `style: 'unit'` option can be passed to the `formatOptions` property to format the value with a unit of measurement. The `unit` option must also be passed to set which unit to use (e.g. `inch`). In addition, the `unitDisplay` option can be used to choose whether to display the unit in `long`, `short`, or `narrow` format.

If you need to allow the user to change the unit, you should include a separate dropdown next to the number field. The number field itself will not determine the unit from the user input.

Note: The unit style is not currently supported in Safari. A [polyfill](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-numberformat/) may be necessary.

```html
<sp-field-label for="units">Package width</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field
    id="units"
    value="4"
    format-options='{
        "style": "unit",
        "unit": "inch",
        "unitDisplay": "long"
    }'
></sp-number-field>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="custom-units">Custom Units</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="custom-units">

While `Intl.NumberFormatOptions` does support a [wide range of units](https://tc39.es/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat/section6/locales-currencies-tz_proposed_out.html#sec-issanctionedsimpleunitidentifier), it is possible to encounter units (e.g. the graphics units of `pixel`, `pixels`, `points`, etc.) that are not supported therein. When this occurs, an `<sp-number-field>` element will attempt to polyfill support for this unit. See the following example delivering `{ style: "unit", unit: "px" }` below:

```html
<sp-field-label for="units">Document width in pixels</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field
    id="units"
    value="500"
    format-options='{
        "style": "unit",
        "unit": "px"
    }'
></sp-number-field>
```

Note: the polyfilling done here is very simplistic and is triggered by supplying options that would otherwise cause the `Intl.NumberFormat()` call to throw an error. Once the unsupporting unit of `px` causes the construction of the object to throw, a back up formatter/parser pair will be created without the supplied unit data. When the `style` is set to `unit`, the `unit` value of will be adopted as the _static_ unit display. This means that neither pluralization or translation will be handled within the `<sp-number-field>` element itself. If pluralization or translation is important to the delivered interface, please be sure to handle passing those strings into to element via the `formatOptions` property reactively to the value of the element or locale of that page in question.

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="min-max">Minimum and maximum values</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="min-max">

The `min` and `max` properties can be used to limit the entered value to a specific range. The value will be clamped when the user commits the value to the `<sp-number-field>` element. In addition, the increment and decrement buttons will be disabled when the value is within one step value from the bounds. Ranges can be open ended by only providing a value for either `min` or `max` rather than both.

If a valid range is known ahead of time, it is a good idea to provide it to `<sp-number-field>` so it can optimize the experience. For example, when the minimum value is greater than or equal to zero, it is possible to use a numeric keyboard on iOS rather than a full text keyboard (necessary to enter a minus sign).

```html
<sp-field-label for="red">Red value</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field id="red" value="4" min="0" max="255"></sp-number-field>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="step">Step values</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="step">

The step prop can be used to snap the value to certain increments. If there is a `min` defined, the steps are calculated starting from that minimum value. For example, if `min === 2`, and `step === 3`, the valid step values would be 2, 5, 8, 11, etc. If no `min` is defined, the steps are calculated starting from zero and extending in both directions. In other words, such that the values are evenly divisible by the step. A step can be any positive decimal. If no step is defined, any decimal value may be typed, but incrementing and decrementing snaps the value to an integer.

If the user types a value that is between two steps and blurs the input, the value will be snapped to the nearest step. When incrementing or decrementing, the value is snapped to the nearest step that is higher or lower, respectively. When incrementing or decrementing from an empty field, the value starts at the minValue or maxValue, respectively, if defined. Otherwise, the value starts from 0.

```html
<sp-field-label
    for="step"
>Step</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field
    id="step"
    step="10"
></sp-number-field>

<sp-field-label
    for="step-min"
>Step + min</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field
    id="step-min"
    min="2"
    step="3"
></sp-number-field>

<sp-field-label

    min="2"
    max="21"
    step="3"
></sp-number-field>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

### States

#### Invalid

The `invalid` attribute indicates that the number field's value is invalid. When set, appropriate ARIA attributes will be automatically applied.

```html
<sp-field-label for="invalid">
    It's one banana, Michael, how much could it cost?
</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field
    id="invalid"
    invalid
    style="width: 130px"
    value="10"
    min="0"
    max="0.3"
    step="0.01"
    format-options='{
        "style": "currency",
        "currency": "USD",
        "currencyDisplay": "code",
        "currencySign": "accounting",
        "minimumFractionDigits": 2,
        "maximumFractionDigits": 2
    }'
></sp-number-field>
<sp-help-text variant="negative">
    Value should be between $0 and $0.3.
</sp-help-text>
```

#### Valid

The `valid` attribute indicates that the number field's value is valid.

```html
<sp-field-label for="valid">
    It's one banana, Michael, how much could it cost?
</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field
    id="valid"
    valid
    style="width: 130px"
    value="0.23"
    min="0"
    max="0.3"
    step="0.01"
    format-options='{
        "style": "currency",
        "currency": "USD",
        "currencyDisplay": "code",
        "currencySign": "accounting",
        "minimumFractionDigits": 2,
        "maximumFractionDigits": 2
    }'
></sp-number-field>
```

#### Required

Use the `required` attribute to indicate a number field value is required. Dictate the validity or invalidity state of the text entry with the `valid` or `invalid` attributes.

```html
<sp-field-label for="number-1" required>Count</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field id="number-1" valid value="123"></sp-number-field>
<sp-field-label for="number-2" required>Size</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field id="number-2" invalid value="152"></sp-number-field>
```

#### Disabled

The `disabled` attribute prevents the number field from receiving focus or events. The number field will appear faded.

```html
<sp-field-label for="disabled" disabled>Number of tickets</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field id="disabled" disabled value="0"></sp-number-field>
```

#### Read-only

Number fields have a `readonly` attribute for when they’re in the disabled state but still need their labels to be shown. This allows for content to be copied, but not interacted with or changed.

```html
<sp-field-label for="readonly">Number of tickets</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field id="readonly" readonly value="0"></sp-number-field>
```

### Behaviors

The number field works with the following interactions:

- the input field,
- <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd> or <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> keys,
- the scroll wheel, or
- the stepper UI, when not hidden by the `hide-stepper` attribute.

The input value incrementally increases or decreases by the value of the `step` attribute. The <kbd>shift</kbd> key can be used to apply steps at 10 times (or the value of the `step-modifier` attribute times) their normal rate.

#### Default value

The `<sp-number-field>` component doesn't manage a default value by itself. This means that consumers can set the value of the number-field as an empty string by clearing the input. If we want the number-field to reset to a `default-value` when the user clears the input, we can listen for the `change` event on the number-field component and set its value to the desired `default-value` if the input is empty.

```html
<sp-field-label for="default">
    Default value of this number field is 42
</sp-field-label>
<sp-number-field id="default" value="20"></sp-number-field>

<script type="module">
    const numberField = document.querySelector('#default');

    numberField.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
        alert('change');
        const target = event.target;
        if (isNaN(target.value)) {
            target.value = '42';
        }
    });
</script>
```

### Accessibility

#### Labels

Every number field must have a label that clearly describes its purpose. The label can be provided either via the `label` attribute or with an associated `<sp-field-label>` element.

#### Keyboard Navigation

Number fields support the following keyboard interactions:

- <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd> and <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> keys increment and decrement the value
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd> or <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> applies steps at 10 times (or the value of `step-modifier`) the normal rate
- The scroll wheel can be used to increment and decrement the value when focused

#### Help Text

Consider providing help text to explain:

- The expected format of the input
- Any minimum or maximum values
- The meaning of units or special formatting (e.g., currency, percentages)
- Step increments if they differ from the default

<script type="module">
    customElements.whenDefined('sp-number-field').then(() => {
        const numberField = document.querySelector('#default');

        numberField.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
            alert('change');
            const target = event.target;
            if (isNaN(target.value)) {
                target.value = '42';
            }
        });
    });
</script>

│  └─ licenseText: ## Overview

An `<sp-progress-circle>` shows the progression of a system operation such as downloading, uploading, processing, etc. in a visual way. It can represent both determinate and indeterminate progress, helping users understand the status of ongoing operations.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/progress-circle?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/progress-circle)
[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/progress-circle?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/progress-circle)
[![Try it on Stackblitz](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20it%20on-Stackblitz-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-xx1plot6)

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/progress-circle
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-progress-circle>` via:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/progress-circle/sp-progress-circle.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `ProgressCircle` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```
import { ProgressCircle } from '@spectrum-web-components/progress-circle';
```

### Anatomy

A progress circle consists of several key parts:

- A label (via `slot="label"`)
- A progress value (via `progress` attribute)
- An optional indeterminate state (via `indeterminate` attribute)

```html
<sp-progress-circle
    label="Download progress"
    progress="75"
></sp-progress-circle>
```

### Options

#### Sizes

Progress circles come in three sizes to fit various contexts:

<sp-tabs selected="m" auto label="Size Attribute Options">
<sp-tab value="s">Small</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="s">

```html demo
<sp-progress-circle
    size="s"
    label="Small progress indicator"
    progress="42"
></sp-progress-circle>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="m">Medium</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="m">

```html demo
<sp-progress-circle
    label="Medium progress indicator"
    progress="67"
></sp-progress-circle>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="l">Large</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="l">

```html demo
<sp-progress-circle
    size="l"
    label="Large progress indicator"
    progress="89"
></sp-progress-circle>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

#### Static Colors

When displaying over images or colored backgrounds, use the `static-color` attribute for better contrast:

```html demo
<div style="background-color: rgb(15, 15, 15); padding: 20px;">
    <sp-progress-circle
        label="Progress on dark background"
        progress="50"
        static-color="white"
    ></sp-progress-circle>
</div>
```

#### Indeterminate Progress

Use indeterminate progress when the duration cannot be calculated:

```html demo
<sp-progress-circle label="Loading content" indeterminate></sp-progress-circle>
```

### Accessibility

The `<sp-progress-circle>` element implements several accessibility features:

1. **ARIA Role**: Automatically sets `role="progressbar"` for proper semantic meaning
2. **Labeling**:
    - Uses the `label` attribute value as `aria-label`
    - When determinate, adds `aria-valuenow` with the current progress
    - Includes `aria-valuemin="0"` and `aria-valuemax="100"` for the progress range
3. **Status Communication**:
    - Screen readers announce progress updates
    - Indeterminate state is properly conveyed to assistive technologies

#### Best Practices

- Always provide a descriptive `label` that explains what the progress represents
- Use determinate progress when possible to give users a clear sense of completion
- For determinate progress, ensure the `progress` value accurately reflects the actual progress
- Consider using size="l" for primary loading states to improve visibility
- Ensure sufficient color contrast when using `static-color="white"`

```html
<!-- Example with good accessibility -->
<sp-progress-circle
    label="Downloading report.pdf - 24 MB of 50 MB"
    progress="48"
></sp-progress-circle>

<!-- For unknown duration operations -->
<sp-progress-circle
    label="Connecting to server"
    indeterminate
></sp-progress-circle>
```

The `getDeepElementFromPoint` method allows you to obtain the deepest possible element at a given coordinates on the current page. The method will step into any available `shadowRoot`s until it reaches the first element with no `shadowRoot` or no children available at the given coordinates.

### Focusable

The `Focusable` subclass of `LitElement` adds some helpers method and lifecycle coverage in order to support passing focus to a container element inside of a custom element. The Focusable base class handles tabindex setting into shadowed elements automatically and is based heavily on the [aybolit delegate-focus-mixin](https://github.com/web-padawan/aybolit/blob/master/packages/core/src/mixins/delegate-focus-mixin.js).

```javascript
import { Focusable } from '@spectrum-web-components/shared';
import { html } from 'lit-element';

class FocusableButton extends Focusable {
    public static override get styles(): CSSResultArray {
        return [...super.styles];
    }
    public get focusElement(): HTMLElement {
        return this.shadowRoot.querySelector('#button') as HTMLElement;
    }

    protected override render(): TemplateResult {
        return html`
            <button
                id="button"
            >
                Focus for this button is being managed by the focusable base class.
            </button>
        `;
    }
}
```

### FocusVisiblePolyfillMixin

Use this mixin if you would like to leverage `:focus-visible` based selectors in your CSS. [Learn more about the polyfill that powers this.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/focus-visible)

### getActiveElement

Use this helper to find an `activeElement` in your component. [Learn more about tracking active elements over shadow DOM boundaries.](https://dev.to/open-wc/mind-the-document-activeelement-2o9a)

### LikeAnchor

Mix `download`, `label`, `href`, and `target` properties into your element to allow it to act more like an `HTMLAnchorElement`.

### ObserveSlotPresence

When working with styles that are driven by the conditional presence of `<slot>`s in a component's shadow DOM, you will need to track whether light DOM that is meant for that slot exists. Use the `ObserveSlotPresence` mixin to target specific light DOM to observe the presence of and trigger `this.requestUpdate()` calls when content fulfilling that selector comes in and out of availability.

```javascript
import { ObserveSlotPresence } from '@spectrum-web-components/shared';
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit-element';
class ObserveSlotPresenceElement extends ObserveSlotPresence(LitElement, '[slot="conditional-slot"]') {
    // translate the mixin properties into locally understandable language
    protected get hasConditionalSlotContent() {
        return this.slotContentIsPresent;
    }
    protected override render(): TemplateResult {
        return html`
            <button
                id="button"
            >
                ${this.hasConditionalSlotContent
                    ? html`
                        <slot
                            name="conditional-slot"
                        ></slot>
                    `
                    : html``
                }
            </button>
        `;
    }
    protected updated(): void {
        console.log(this.slotContentIsPresent); // => true when <observing-slot-presence-element><div slot="conditional-slot"></div></observing-slot-presence-element>
    }
}
customElements.define('observing-slot-presence-element', ObserveSlotPresenceElement);
```

### ObserveSlotText

When working with `<slot>`s and their `slotchange` event, you will have the opportunity to capture when the nodes and/or elements in your element are added or removed. However, if the `textContent` of a text node changes, you will not receive the `slotchange` event because the slot hasn't actually received new nodes and/or elements in the exchange. When working with a lit-html binding `<your-element>${text}</your-element>` that means you will not receive a `slotchange` event when the value of `text` goes from `text = ''` to `text = 'something'` or the other way. In these cases the `ObserveSlotText` can be leverages to apply a mutation observe onto your element that tracks `characterData` mutations so that you can resspond as desired.

```javascript
import { ObserveSlotText } from '@spectrum-web-components/shared';
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit-element';

class ObserveSlotTextElement extends ObserveSlotText(LitElement, '#observing-slot') {
    protected override render(): TemplateResult {
        return html`
            <button
                id="button"
            >
                <slot
                    id="observing-slot"
                    @slotchange=${this.manageObservedSlot}
                ></slot>
            </button>
        `;
    }
    protected updated(): void {
        console.log(this.slotHasContent); // => true when <observing-slot-text-element>Text</observing-slot-text-element>
    }
}

customElements.define('observing-slot-text-element', ObserveSlotTextElement);

Spectrum Web Components are a [`LitElement`](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org)-powered web component library of patterns built on top of the [Spectrum CSS](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-css) specification. Styles for these components are made available (and, in some cases, customizable) via CSS Custom Properties, e.g. `var(--spectrum-black)`. In this package, you will find the CSS Custom Properties that power the various color and size themes defined by Spectrum CSS.

The easiest way to consume these values is via the `<sp-theme>` element. However, in some cases, it can be useful to have direct access to the files outlining the CSS Custom Properties, on top of which the rest of the component system is built.

`sp-textfield` components are text boxes that allow users to input custom text entries with a keyboard. Various decorations can be displayed around the field to communicate the entry requirements.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/textfield?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/textfield)

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/textfield
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-textfield>` via:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/textfield/sp-textfield.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `Textfield` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```js
import { Textfield } from '@spectrum-web-components/textfield';
```

### Anatomy

```html
<sp-textfield id="basic" label="Name"></sp-textfield>
```

#### Label

A text field must have a label in order to be accessible. A label can be provided either via the `label` attribute, like the previous example or with an `<sp-field-label>` element.

```html
<sp-field-label for="with-field-label">Name</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield id="with-field-label"></sp-textfield>
```

#### Placeholder

Use the `placeholder` attribute to include placeholder text. **Note**: Placeholder text should not be used as a replacement for a label or help help text.

```html
<sp-field-label for="has-placeholder">Name</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield id="has-placeholder" placeholder="ex., John Doe"></sp-textfield>
```

#### Help text

Help text can be accessibly associated with an `<sp-textfield>` element by using the `help-text` or `negative-help-text` slots. When using the `negative-help-text` slot, `<sp-textfield>` will self manage the presence of this content based on the value of the `invalid` property on your `<sp-textfield>` element. Content within the `help-text` slot will be show by default. When your `<sp-textfield>` should receive help text based on state outside of the complexity of `invalid` or not, manage the content addressed to the `help-text` from above to ensure that it displays the right messaging and possesses the right `variant`.

See [help text](../help-text) for more information.

<sp-tabs selected="self" auto label="Help text usage in textfields">
<sp-tab value="self">Self managed</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="self">

```html
<sp-field-label for="self">Stay "Positive"</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield id="self" pattern="[P][o][s][i][t][i][v][e]" value="Positive">

        Tell us how you are feeling today.
    </sp-help-text>
    <sp-help-text slot="negative-help-text">Please be "Positive".</sp-help-text>

        const helpText = this.querySelector(`[slot="help-text"]`);
        helpText.textContent = this.invalid ? `Please be "Positive".` : `Tell us how you are feeling today.`;
        helpText.variant = this.invalid ? `negative` : `neutral`;

<sp-tab value="s">Small</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="s">

```html
<sp-field-label size="s" for="name-0-s">Name</sp-field-label>

<sp-tab-panel value="l">

```html
<sp-field-label size="l" for="name-0-l">Name</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield
    size="l"
    id="name-0-l"
    placeholder="Enter your name"
></sp-textfield>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
<sp-tab value="xl">Extra Large</sp-tab>
<sp-tab-panel value="xl">

```html
<sp-field-label size="xl" for="name-0-xl">Name</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield
    size="xl"
    id="name-0-xl"
    placeholder="Enter your name"
></sp-textfield>
```

</sp-tab-panel>
</sp-tabs>

#### Types

When inputting URLs, telephone numbers, email addresses, or passwords, specify a `type` to provide
user affordances like mobile keyboards and obscured characters:

- `url`
- `tel`
- `email`
- `password`
- `text` (default)

```html
<sp-field-label for="tel-1">Telephone</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield
    id="tel-1"
    type="tel"
    placeholder="Enter your phone number"
></sp-textfield>
<sp-field-label for="password-1">Password</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield id="password-1" type="password"></sp-textfield>
```

If the `type` attribute is not specified, or if it does not match any of these values, the default type adopted is "text."

#### Quiet

The quiet style works best when a clear layout (vertical stack, table, grid) assists in a user's ability to parse the element. Too many quiet components in a small space can be hard to read.

```html
<sp-field-label for="name-3">Name (quietly)</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield id="name-3" placeholder="Enter your name" quiet></sp-textfield>
```

### States

Use the `required` attribute to indicate a textfield value is required. Dictate the validity or invalidity state of the text entry with the `valid` or `invalid` attributes.

```html
<sp-field-label for="name-1" required>Name</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield
    id="name-1"
    placeholder="Enter your name"
    valid
    value="My Name"
></sp-textfield>
<br />
<sp-field-label for="name-2" required>Name</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield id="name-2" invalid placeholder="Enter your name"></sp-textfield>
```

### Accessibility

#### Include a label

Every text field should have a label. A field without a label is ambiguous and not accessible.

#### Include help text

The description in the help text is flexible and encompasses a range of guidance. Sometimes this guidance is about what to input, and sometime it’s about how to input. This includes information such as:

- An overall description of the input field
- Hints for what kind of information needs to be input
- Specific formatting examples or requirements

Learn more about [using help text](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/text-field/#Use-help-text-to-show-hints,-formatting,-and-requirements).

#### Include negative help text

Write error messaging in a human-centered way by guiding a user and showing them a solution — don’t simply state what’s wrong and then leave them guessing as to how to resolve it. Ambiguous error messages can be frustrating and even shame-inducing for users. Also, keep in mind that something that a system may deem an error may not actually be perceived as an error to a user.

Learn more about [writing error messages](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/text-field/#Write-error-text-that-shows-a-solution).

#### Do not us a placeholder as a replacement for a label or help-text

Putting instructions for how to complete an input, requirements, or any other essential information into placeholder text is not accessible. Once a value is entered, placeholder text is no longer viewable; if someone is using an automatic form filler, they will never get the information in the placeholder text.

Instead, use the help text description to convey requirements or to show any formatting examples that would help user comprehension. If there's placeholder text and help text at the same time, it becomes redundant and distracting, especially if they're communicating the same thing.

`sp-theme` applies a Spectrum theme by using CSS custom properties to set default sizes & colors for all of the components in its scope. The Spectrum design system provides four color themes (`lightest`, `light`, `dark`, and `darkest`) and two different scales (`medium` and `large`) to support desktop & mobile UI.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/theme?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/theme)
[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/theme?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/theme)

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/theme
```

#### Quick start

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/sp-theme.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/src/themes.js';
```

The above import statements do two things: the first will get you started using the `<sp-theme>` wrapper element, and the second includes all four (4) color options (`lightest`, `light`, `dark`, and `darkest`) and both (2) scale options (`medium` and `large`) for the Spectrum Classic theme. Having all of these options available together is the easiest way to get a handle on the theming possibilities offered by the package and empowers you to prototype and test various deliveries of your application. However, reserving the download and parse time for all of the variants may not be required for all applications. See the "Advanced usage" section below for instructions on tuning the performance of an application that leverages this package.

Below are more ways to import the different scale and color options individually, in case you didn't want to import all of them as we did above. You'll use these statements in combination with the side effectful registration import statement `import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/sp-theme.js'`.

The various Classic themes can be imported en masse, as in the example above:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/src/themes.js';
```

The various Spectrum Express themes can also be imported en masse:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/src/express/themes.js';
```

Or you can import the themes and scales individually:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-darkest.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-dark.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-light.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-lightest.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/scale-medium.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/scale-large.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-darkest.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-dark.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-light.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-lightest.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/scale-medium.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/scale-large.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `Theme` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```
import { Theme } from '@spectrum-web-components/theme';
```

## What it's doing

Visually, all Spectrum Web Components are an expression of the design tokens specified by Spectrum, Adobe's design system. On the web, these tokens are made available as CSS Custom Properties. Using `sp-theme` as a parent element for your components ensures that those CSS Custom Properties can be leveraged by the elements within your application. This ensures consistent delivery of not only the color and scale you've specified in your particular instance, but for _all_ the other color, scale, and content direction specifications across Spectrum.

Additionally, the `sp-theme` element manages the content direction applied to the elements in its DOM scope. By default, an `sp-theme` element resolves its initial content direction from the value specified by its first `sp-theme` or `document` ancestor; otherwise, it uses the value `dir="ltr"` if a content direction isn't present in those elements. When a value for `dir` is manually supplied to `sp-theme`, the default value is overridden. In all cases, though, `sp-theme` manages the `dir` value of its `SpectrumElement` descendents, unless another `sp-theme` element is placed into its scope and overrides that management.

To make the above concepts a little more concrete, take a look at the table below. Try selecting another `color` in the picker, and notice how that changes the values of the colors. The token names for the variables persist, but the RGB values under the hood change! Considering that `sp-theme` also manages all the other theme and size options, `sp-theme` reveals itself to be a pretty powerful component.

<custom-vars-viewer id="color-tokens"></custom-vars-viewer>

<script type="module">
    const varsViewer = document.querySelector('custom-vars-viewer');
    const options = {
        rootMargin: '20px'
    }
    const callback = async (entries, observer) => {
        if (entries[0].intersectionRatio === 0) return;
        import('@spectrum-web-components/custom-vars-viewer/custom-vars-viewer.js').then(() => {
            const queryThemeEvent = new CustomEvent('sp-track-theme', {
                bubbles: true,
                composed: true,
                detail: {
                    callback: (color) => {
                        varsViewer.themeColor = color.startsWith('light')
                            ? 'light'
                            : color;
                    },
                },
                cancelable: true,
            });
            varsViewer.dispatchEvent(queryThemeEvent);
        });
        observer.disconnect();
    }

    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options);
    observer.observe(varsViewer);
</script>

When you're ready to look into more advanced usage of the components and themes in your application, there are vanilla CSS implementations of these tokens available in the `@spectrum-web-components/styles` package.

## Example

An `<sp-theme>` element expects a value for each of its `color` and `scale` attributes to be provided on the element. While not required, you can also use the `system` attribute to specify whether the theme you're using is Spectrum Classic (the default), Spectrum 2 (upcoming release) or Spectrum Express.

```html
<sp-theme
    system="spectrum"
    color="light"
    scale="medium"
    style="background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100)"
>
    <sp-button onclick="spAlert(this, 'Themed <sp-button> clicked!')">
        Click me!
    </sp-button>
</sp-theme>
```

## Advanced usage

Once you've moved beyond the prototype phase of an application, it is likely that you will only use one combination of `color` and `scale` in your application, and even if not, you'll likely benefit from lazily loading the variants you don't leverage by default. For single combination applications, or to power a _default_ theme, the following imports can be used to ensure only the code your application requires is loaded:

### Classic

```js
/**
 * Power a site using
 *
 * <sp-theme
 *      system="spectrum"
 *      color="darkest"
 *      scale="large"
 * >

```

### Express

```js
/**
 * Power a site using
 *
 * <sp-theme
 *      system="express"
 *      color="light"
 *      scale="medium"
 * >
 **/
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/theme-light.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/express/scale-medium.js';

import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/sp-theme.js';
```

When subsequent theme variants are needed, you can ensure those are lazily loaded by leveraging dynamic imports via something like:

```js
const themeElement = document.querySelector('sp-theme');

const updateTheme = async (color, scale) => {
    Promise.all([
        import(`@spectrum-web-components/theme/theme-${color}.js`),
        import(`@spectrum-web-components/theme/scale-${scale}.js`),
    ]).then(() => {
        themeElement.color = color;
        themeElement.scale = scale;
    });
};

updateTheme('light', 'medium');
```

When bundling your application, be sure to consult the documentation of your bundler for the correct way to ensure proper packaging of the programatic dependency graph that this will create.

## Light theme

```html demo
<style type="text/css">
    #example {
        max-width: 500px;
        padding: 3em;
        background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100);
        color: var(--spectrum-gray-800);
    }

    #buttons {
        margin-top: 2em;
    }
</style>
<sp-theme system="express" color="light" scale="medium">
    <hzn-app-stuff></hzn-app-stuff>
</sp-theme>

<express-app>
    <hzn-app-stuff></hzn-app-stuff>
</express-app>
```

## Dark theme

```html demo
<style type="text/css">
    #example {
        max-width: 500px;
        padding: 3em;
        background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100);
        color: var(--spectrum-gray-800);
    }

    #buttons {
        margin-top: 2em;
    }
</style>
<sp-theme system="express" color="dark" scale="large">
    <hzn-app-stuff></hzn-app-stuff>
</sp-theme>

<express-app>
    <hzn-app-stuff></hzn-app-stuff>
</express-app>
```

## Large scale

The large scale of `<sp-theme>` will switch to using Spectrum's larger mobile [Platform Scale](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/platform-scale/)

```html demo
<style type="text/css">
    #example {
        max-width: 500px;
        padding: 1em;
        background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100);
        color: var(--spectrum-gray-800);
    }

    #buttons {
        margin-top: 2em;
    }
</style>
<sp-theme color="darkest" scale="large">
    <div id="example">
        <div>
            <sp-slider
                value="5"
                step="1"
                min="1"
                max="11"
                label="Volume"
                id="volume-slider"
            ></sp-slider>
        </div>
        <div><sp-switch>Overdrive</sp-switch></div>
        <sp-button-group id="buttons">
            <sp-button variant="primary">Cancel</sp-button>
            <sp-button variant="accent">Continue</sp-button>
        </sp-button-group>
    </div>
</sp-theme>
```

## Embedding themes

There are a few cases where it is necessary to embed one theme within another.
For example, if you have an application that is using a dark theme with a left to right text direction that is
previewing or editing content that will be displayed in a light theme with a right to left text direction.

```html
<style type="text/css">
    #outer {
        max-width: 500px;
        padding: 1em;
        background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100);
        color: var(--spectrum-gray-800);
    }

    #inner {
        margin-top: 2em;
        padding: 1em;
        background-color: var(--spectrum-gray-100);
        color: var(--spectrum-gray-800);
    }

    #buttons {
        margin-top: 2em;
    }
</style>
<sp-theme color="dark" dir="ltr">
    <div id="outer">
        <div>
            <sp-slider
                value="5"
                step="1"
                min="1"
                max="11"
                label="Volume"
                id="volume-slider"
            ></sp-slider>
        </div>
        <div><sp-switch>Overdrive</sp-switch></div>
        <sp-button-group id="buttons">
            <sp-button variant="primary">Cancel</sp-button>
            <sp-button variant="accent">Continue</sp-button>
        </sp-button-group>
        <sp-theme color="light" dir="rtl">
            <div id="inner">
                <div>
                    <sp-slider
                        value="5"
                        step="1"
                        min="1"
                        max="11"
                        label="Volume"
                        id="volume-slider"
                    ></sp-slider>
                </div>
                <div><sp-switch>Overdrive</sp-switch></div>
                <sp-button-group id="buttons">
                    <sp-button variant="primary">Cancel</sp-button>
                    <sp-button variant="accent">Continue</sp-button>
                </sp-button-group>
            </div>
        </sp-theme>
    </div>
</sp-theme>
```

## Language Context

The `<sp-theme>` element provides a language context for its descendents in the DOM. Descendents can resolve this context by dispatching an `sp-language-context` DOM event and supplying a `callback(lang: string) => void` method in the `detail` entry of the Custom Event. These callbacks will be reactively envoked when the `lang` attribute on the `<sp-theme>` element is updated. This way, you can control the resolved language in [`<sp-number-field>`](../components/number-field), [`<sp-slider>`](./components/slider), and other elements in one centralized place.

## System Context (private Beta API - subject to changes)

The <sp-theme> element provides a "system" context to its descendants in the DOM. This context indicates the Spectrum design system variant currently in use (e.g., 'spectrum', 'express', or 'spectrum-two').

#### Consuming the System Context in Components

Components can consume the system context by using the `SystemResolutionController`. This controller encapsulates the logic for resolving the system context, allowing it to be integrated into any component in few steps.

#### Steps to Consume the System Context:

1. Import the `SystemResolutionController` and the necessary types:

```ts
import {
    SystemResolutionController,
    systemResolverUpdatedSymbol,
} from './SystemResolutionController.js';
import type { SystemVariant } from '@spectrum-web-components/theme';
```

2. Instantiate the `SystemResolutionController`:

    In your component class, create an instance of SystemResolutionController, passing `this` as the host element.

```ts
export class MyComponent extends LitElement {
    private systemResolver = new SystemResolutionController(this);

    // Rest of your component code...
}
```

3. Respond to system context changes:

    Override the `update` lifecycle method to detect changes in the system context using the `systemResolverUpdatedSymbol`.

```ts
protected update(changes: Map<PropertyKey, unknown>): void {
  super.update(changes);
  if (changes.has(systemResolverUpdatedSymbol)) {
    this.handleSystemChange();
  }
}
```

4. Implement the handler for system changes:

    Create a method that will be called whenever the system context changes. Use `this.systemResolver.system` to access the current system variant.

```ts
private handleSystemChange(): void {
  const currentSystem: SystemVariant = this.systemResolver.system;
  // Implement logic based on the current system variant.
  // For example, update styles, states or re-render parts of the component.
}
```

5. Use the system context in other parts of your component logic and/or template:

    You can now use `this.systemResolver.system` anywhere in your component to adjust behavior or rendering based on the system variant.

```ts
render() {
  return html`
    <div>
      <!-- Use the system context in your rendering logic -->
      Current system variant: ${this.systemResolver.system}
    </div>
  `;
}
